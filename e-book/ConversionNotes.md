# Conversion Notes
## General
* Used Metropolis font rather than Monserrat - medium looks really good.
* Used "BNA Pink" colour #fc28a7 as the accent colour for hyperlinks and initial letters.
* Resized large images to 600px wide to save space.
* Indented paragraphs are more readable, then spaced out.

## Chapter specific
* Removed the vertical text front matter as it's not applicable to this book.
* Shortened Amazon link to the Japanese paperback to: https://www.amazon.com/dp/4086313642 (Note: Amazon links can be shortened just to the ASIN)
