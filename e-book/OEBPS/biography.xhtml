	<p class="noindent top">Thank you very much for picking up this work. It's nice to meet you. For those of you who haven't seen me in a while. I′m Ise. This time, I've written a spin-off of the anime “BNA” written by Trigger Inc. In the anime, the main setting is Anima City, a town where only beastmen live, so in the novel, I tried to approach the world outside of Anima City, a world where beastmen (jiyujin) and humans are mixed together. With no clear borders to separate them, what are their lives really like? This is an attempt to find out through two beastmen who travel through a time when the relationship between the two races is at its most dangerous.</p>
		<p>Please note that the following contains spoilers.</p>
		<p>The main characters in this story are Shirou Ogami, the representative of the beastmen, and Barballet Rosé, who is the mayor of Anima City in the anime. Unlike the anime's protagonist, Michiru, who is a former human, these two are purely beastmen in their perspective. As an author, I love strong and twisted characters like Shirou. He's strong to the point of it being almost bullshit, but he's also unbalanced and inflexible. This dichotomy is the source of his strength, but at the same time it is the most fragile part of him.</p>
		<p>Rosé-Natalia was a girl who could counter-attack Shirou. Not just because she was around him, but also because Natalia had the same anger as Shirou, but had come to a different way of thinking. She was fully qualified to compete with his bottomless anger. This was an approach that Michiru, who had lived as a human in a human town in her past, could not take.</p>
		<p>In the end, was Natalia able to save Shirou? I will not give that answer now, but wait for the story of the next era.</p>
		<p>The following are my acknowledgments.</p>
		<p>Mr. Nakashima, the scriptwriter, who gave me a great deal of background information in writing this story. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the staff who gave me hints on how to incorporate the magnificent setting into each person's story. I couldn't include everything, but the hints were an extremely important foundation for the story of Shirou and Natalia. Thanks to all of you, I was able to create the spin-off novel “BNA ZERO: Beasts Who Can′t Be Clean”. Thanks to the staff of Trigger for bringing the visuals from the anime directly into the novel. The mayor is so cute. I wish I could have my hair from my childhood back. To the proofreaders who never allow typos and omissions, I′m sure there were a lot of them this time….I′m really sorry. To the person in charge of the project, who had an absolutely tough time adjusting this time. Thank you for your hard work.</p>
		<p>Last but not least. A stubborn man needs a place where he can cower and cry. Even more so because he has already lost it.</p>
		<p>So let's meet again somewhere else.</p>
