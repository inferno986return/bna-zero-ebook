	<h1 class="heading">Chapter 1 – Scapegoat</h1>

	<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">“</span>World War II” seemed to be the name of this war.</p>
		<p>She didn’t think that was the official name. It was just called that because of the connection between the various battles that took place in different locations, with each battle having a different name: some kind of war, some kind of invasion, some kind of naval battle, and so on.</p>
		<p>She was not interested in the names of the battles, but the irony was that it was thanks to the demonic scientists in the beastman camp that Natalia, who lived in a small hidden village deep in the forest, became aware of the situation in the supposedly distant human world.</p>
		<p>As she laid on the lab table, breathless and her body tortured, she naturally overheard the words of the dull, white-coated, scientists around her.</p>
		<p>The countries of humans had begun to fight all over the world. The scientists’ country was outnumbered, and in order to turn the tide, they had turned to the power of the beastmen and were trying to acquire it.</p>
		<p>The stories she remembered from them were enough to make her realize how prosperous the human race was.</p>
		<p>However, they perished.</p>
		<p>At the least the people who had captured them were defeated in another battle. It was soon after the Silver God had rescued the beastmen from the camps. However, this did not mean that the world was completely restored to normal. The dead do not come back to life, and the beastmen who were caught up in the disaster were now homeless.</p>
		<p>The sky was light grayish in color, and the smell of gunpowder and the black smoke of battle still lingered in the air. From what she heard; some countries are still at war. She wondered if this burning wind had come from such a distant place, but couldn’t help but think about the problem at hand.</p>
		<p>“I′m hungry.......” she said to the sky as if she were talking to it.</p>
		<p>Natalia walked down a long, long country road in some region of Europe. She didn′t know what the humans called it. She was a young girl in her early teens, her face buried in the collar of a cape she had picked up along the way. She was short, and the hem of her adult cape reached just below her knees, making it look like a raincoat.</p>
		<p>“You said the same thing about thirty minutes ago. If you have the pride of a beastman, you should be able to stomach a little hunger.”</p>
		<p>The fellow walking next to her naturally recognized that she was speaking to him and replied calmly.</p>
		<p>“There’s a town coming up. I’m sure they’ll be cooking up some soup there.”</p>
		<p>“You said the same thing an hour ago.......” she said, her lips pursed in frustration as he refused to give her even a shred of sympathy.</p>
		<p>Natalia looked down the road as it disappeared over the rise of the hill. If there was more wilderness beyond the hill, she decided, she would pass out right there without thinking. She had survived the hellish beastman camp, but death lay everywhere. Rather than thinking of it as unreasonable or cruel, she felt a little bitter about the fact that, as a beast, she was so quick to take it for granted. Death is a very familiar thing. Even though the war is over, the battle continues. The battle to survive after the war.</p>
		<p>Natalia, who was separated from her family and her people back in the camps, was a typical example of this. She didn’t know how to get back to her hometown - she knows it burned down without a trace - but she also didn’t have the means to survive in a human land. She was almost doomed to die in a corner of some strange city, but the man walking next to her saved her, just like he did in the prison camp. The legendary savior, the Silver Wolf. The hero of fairy tales that lived for a thousand years, was right next to her.</p>
		<p>Natalia gently looked up at his face. The adoration and longing that had flooded her heart when she first met him shriveled up as soon as she saw the dewy face of a man with the grimace of a starving beast.</p>
		<p>Natalia asks, “You don’t have much patience, do you, Mr. Ogami?”</p>
		<p>“I have plenty, there is a huge difference when I’ve lost patience,” he responded flatly.</p>
		<p>“I’m not sure if you are being serious or joking," Natalia said, sighing at the image of “God” growing more tattered and ragged in her mind.</p>
		<p>Shirou Ogami, that was the name of the legendary savior. Slender and tall. Dull gray hair. He had a quiet look in his eyes, which sounds good, but in reality, the word “dull” would be more appropriate. It was hard to believe that these were the eyes of a god who could see everything with acute clarity, and combined with the deep, hard wrinkles between his eyebrows that looked as if they had been carved into rock, they gave a coldhearted impression and power.</p>
		<p>“I really hope there is a town,....... I’m sure there is…..There must be,” Shirou said.</p>
		<p>Natalia, who had been moving her feet mindlessly, overheard the slightest hint of weakness in his voice, and looked up at the sky when she heard a shadow overhead cawing.</p>
		<p>“Kuro!”</p>
		<p>A single crow circled around them in search of a place to land. It was a fellow survivor who had been captured in the beastman camp and had stuck with them after they escaped together. They've been friends ever since.</p>
		<p>Kuro aimed for Shirou’s shoulder, but one look from him made him feel unapproachable, and he rushed back and landed on Natalia’s head.</p>
		<p>“Come on, Kuro. If you're going to perch, perch on my shoulder. You'll get mud in my hair,” complained Natalia.</p>
		<p>“Kaa!” Kuro squealed apologetically and jumped down to her shoulder, handing Natalia the object in his beak. Then, disliking the too-narrow shoulders, he went back to her head.</p>
		<p>“Is this ...... money?” Natalia asked.</p>
		<p>It was an unfamiliar coin, but it looked like it was definitely human-made. Kuro had flown over the hill. If that’s the case, there’s a good chance there’s a human town ahead.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami...?” Natalia started.</p>
		<p>“What are you doing? Let’s get a move on.” The savior had already started walking at an increased speed, leaving Kuro and Natalia to their own devices.</p>
		<p>“Wait, wait, wait, already!” exclaimed Natalia.</p>
		<p>The world outside her hometown was much bigger than Natalia had imagined, and the legend of the silver wolf was at the highest point, yet he was right next to her, which felt unfortunately familiar.</p>
		<p>As it turned out, the town was there. Not a big city like the one where Natalia had been held captive, but a much smaller town. Even from a distance, they could see crumbling houses and cracked roads, and half-wild livestock grazing in the vicinity, as if they had been run out or escaped. Once inside the town, however, the expressions on the faces of the people on the street were not gloomy. Natalia had no idea where the borders of the human country were, but it seemed that this town was on the side of the victors in the war.</p>
		<p>The town looked much more developed and beautiful than her hometown, with its rows of houses with bright red roofs on top of elaborate white brick walls.</p>
		<p>“Beautiful ......,” she murmured, taking in the scene for a moment.</p>
		<p>Natalia had a great respect for humans. She admired human beings and the culture they had created. This was extremely unusual for beastmen who tended to avoid getting involved with humans and human society. Not only that, but she was also different from others in that she was sensitive and thoughtful, whereas most beastmen are insensitive and crass. She was always looking at the few human books in the village chief’s house, which made the other beastmen - even her own family - look at her like she was an oddity.</p>
		<p>“She’s reading a book about humans again.”</p>
		<p>“I wonder why she’s so interested in those things. I've taught her it’s best to stay away from humans.”</p>
		<p>“The village chief is a village chief, but they read books together.......”</p>
		<p>Natalia hated them for talking like that. She hated the beastmen. The only person who was on her side was the village chief, who said that he used to live in human lands. He said,</p>
		<p>“Natalia, you are a wise woman with a keen eye for detail. It is never safe to approach humans, but one day you will experience their culture for real, and feel it with an honest heart.”</p>
		<p>Thinking back, she wondered if he had ever spoken ill of humans in one way or another. That day when her hometown burned down. While the inhabitants of the village she had hated were grieving, Natalia was glad, if only a little, that their closed world was coming to an end.</p>
		<p>She hoped to be able to approach the human world. Now that she knows the harsh fate that awaited her, she can’t help but think that it was a shallow hope. ......</p>
		<p>Her thoughts begin to drift, Beautiful? That’s what you're saying again. It’s a human town, this is .......this is the first time you’ve ever seen such a thing. Have you forgotten what humans have done to you? This is the place they created.</p>
		<p>Just as her anger was rising from the pit of her stomach, a metallic clang ...... pulled Natalia’s consciousness out of her head and into the real world.</p>
		<p>At the same time with the sound came an unmistakable smell. As if caught by the sound, she naturally tilted her body and heard a happy voice passing by.</p>
		<p>“Hey. It’s a soup kitchen. Let’s go,” said Shirou as he passed.</p>
		<p>“Thank God. I’m starving,” followed Natalia.</p>
		<p>The residents of the town looked somewhat gray. All kinds of people, young and old, men and women, were making their way to the square. Before Natalia knew it, she was running after them. A crowd of people had gathered in front of the stores facing the square. They seemed to be handing out stew, as she looked from side to side at the satisfied faces dispersing from the front of the store. Natalia waited in line, and soon it was her turn.</p>
		<p>“Um, is this enough?” she asked nervously, as she held out the coin that Kuro had picked up.</p>
		<p>She knew a little bit about human society, but she didn’t have a clue about the market. The older woman with the cauldron behind her smiled and handed her a plate of stew, saying,</p>
		<p>“You're a well-behaved young lady with a crow on your head, you don’t have to pay for it. Eat plenty of food and get on with your day.”</p>

		<p>Natalia returned to Shirou as she ate from the stew on her plate. It was warm, spicy, and cheesy. As a reward, she shared a large potato with Kuro, who had led them to the town.</p>
		<p>“Aren’t you going to go get in line?” Natalia, who had eaten about half of the potatoes and was coming to her senses, asked when she noticed that Shirou was standing against the wall of the square, with his arms crossed tightly and not moving.</p>
		<p>“I will not accept any treatment from humans,” Shirou said curtly.</p>
		<p>This stubbornness brought a chill to the inside of Natalia’s thin chest. It was more than just a feeling of dismay that she had been so hungry causing her to frown now.</p>
		<p>“He is the same,” she thought.</p>
		<p>He’s a god. He’s a great savior who has been saving beastmen for a thousand years, but he’s no different from the stubborn, narrow-minded, unbalanced beastmen back home. They mock human beings and human things, refusing to acknowledge their existence or their value. She had believed that God was more intelligent and generous like the sea.</p>
		<p>“Well, eat this, please.”</p>
		<p>Natalia thrust the plate of stew at Shirou, who was unsure of what she was so angry about.</p>
		<p>“You can take charity from a beastman, can’t you?” She stated bluntly.</p>
		<p>Shirou looked a little taken aback.</p>
		<p>“What’s this? That stew is for you. You must still be hungry. Eat more.”</p>
		<p>Natalia retorts, “I've always been a small eater, so I've had enough. Please eat. If you collapse, I won’t be able to carry you by myself. If that happens, I’ll have a human help me, is that okay?”</p>
		<p>“............”</p>
		<p>Shirou frowned extremely intensely as he imagined this scene, and finally accepted the stew plate. He was trying to keep a dour look on his face, but as soon as he put the spoon in his mouth, it loosened slightly, and Natalia, who was staring at him, couldn’t miss it.</p>
		<p>“............”</p>
		<p>She was not sure if he realized he was being watched or not, but he hurriedly turned his head in the direction of the sun and began to eat the stew, but it was too late. It would have been a sight to behold if he had grown a tail, Natalia thought with a wry smile. Kuro squealed and laughed along with her. Even a silver wolf can’t fight hunger. That’s why she wanted to feed him even if she had to.</p>

		<p>Suddenly, a clear sound and color spread across the square. The people who had been holding their empty stew plates and looking up at the grayish sky shifted their gazes in one direction. Natalia followed suit, and saw a man plucking a musical instrument with countless strings. The sounds, which had started out as one, soon came together like the folds of a curtain swaying in the wind, bringing a sense of peace and tranquility to the desolate site of the soup kitchen, where signs of war still lingered.</p>
		<p>“What the hell is that?” Asked Shirou.</p>
		<p>Natalia responded, “It’s a zither. It’s a zither, Mr. Ogami.”</p>
		<p>Natalia, who had only seen the instrument in books, raised her voice at the sight and sound of it.</p>
		<p>“A zither? Isn’t that just a guitar?”</p>
		<p>“It’s a more difficult instrument. It’s a beautiful sound.......”</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes and listened. Beastmen also have songs and music, but they are simple at best, primitive at worst, and not as complex, delicate, and free as this.</p>
		<p>Human beings are amazing, after all…. This feeling of admiration began to swell in her heart, but it was suddenly crushed by something.</p>
		<p>Why?</p>
		<p>She couldn’t help but look at Shirou’s face, but although he looked unhappy, he kept his mouth tightly shut and didn’t say anything. It wasn’t his voice that had just put a damper on the excitement. It was something inside of her.</p>
		<p>Anger. Sadness. Pain.</p>
		<p>Natalia, realizing that she could no longer find the honest feelings she had earlier, cast a resentful glance around the square, as if taking it out on herself. Suddenly, she saw a group of men wearing the same clothes. Men in military uniforms, which she had seen many times before coming here. They looked like they had just returned to the town after a battle, and they were saying something to the people who were there.</p>
		<p>“My friend in the war saw a U-boat take a breath,” said one man.</p>
		<p>“What the hell? My war buddy’s war buddy saw the British blow up a tank by rolling a bomb that looked like a tire,” said another.</p>

		<p>No one was seriously listening to the upbeat faces and voices of the four sides of the war. All the people around them smiled and listened to their stories as if they were the ramblings of drunks mixed in with the sound of the zither.</p>
		<p>But, then.</p>
		<p>“By the way, the beastman unit was terrifying.”</p>
		<p>“Yeah. Yeah, they were extraordinary.”</p>
		<p>As soon as the words were mentioned, the calm atmosphere that had been flowing until then stagnated.</p>
		<p>“Are beastmen, you know, still bad?” One of the audience members asked fearfully, and the returning soldier, perhaps pleased by the interest shown in him, answered in a higher tone of voice.</p>
		<p>“Oh, my God, that was nothing short of insane. They suddenly turned into beasts, guns didn’t work, they threw tanks with their bare hands, and they did whatever they wanted. Our troops were no match for them, but they were not to be outdone. We lured them into a trap, and we all attacked at once.......”</p>
		<p>There was more to the story that would have made a beastman furious, but the townspeople hardly seemed to be listening anymore. They all exchanged glances with a hint of anger, and then looked down at their toes.</p>
		<p>“There are beastmen in this town, it seems,” Shirou’s quiet words shook Natalia’s shoulders.</p>
		<p>“The people here are thinking about it right now.”</p>
		<p>As Shirou calmly analyzed the situation with his eyes, Natalia remembered why he, and she, were wandering around like this. To save beastmen who were being tormented by humans, that was the purpose of the Silver Wolf’s long, long journey. Natalia, who had been picked up by him along the way, was also helping him.</p>
		<p>“Let’s go see.”</p>
		<p>He put the plate down and walked away, and Natalia hurriedly followed him, but made sure to return the plate to the woman who gave it to her, and thanked her for it.</p>
		<p>It wasn’t long before they found where the beastmen lived. Shirou, who was accustomed to finding beastmen, was able to determine their general location just from the attitudes and signs of people on the street, without having to “beastify” himself into a wolf beastman. The house was an ordinary red-roofed house with no particular difference from the others.</p>

		<p>“I’m sorry,” said Natalia as she knocked on the door and a friendly old man peeked out from inside. He looked at her, his eyes slightly widened through his reading glasses.</p>
		<p>“Oh, ....... Are you beastmen?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, I’m Natalia and this is Mr. Ogami.”</p>
		<p>When Natalia introduced the unfriendly Shirou with one hand, the old man smiled softly and opened the door wide.</p>
		<p>“It’s been a long time since I've seen a beast outside of my family. Please, come on in.”</p>
		<p>The living room was neat and clean, which was probably a normal sight in this town, but to</p>
		<p>Natalia, who until recently had lived in a crass beastman village, it looked very elegant and clean.</p>
		<p>“Who’s that, father? Oh, we have visitors.”</p>
		<p>The family was gathered in the living room, the cups on the table smelling of something</p>
		<p>Natalia had never smelled before. It seemed that it was time for a family introduction. Natalia introduced herself again, and they welcomed her. There were five of them: the old Merry couple, their son and his wife, and a small baby. Other than this family, there seemed to be no other beastmen living in this town.</p>
		<p>“You seem to be traveling a long way, where are you from?” Old Robert Merry, the head of the family, spoke softly to Natalia. His mannerisms reminded Natalia of the village chief back home.</p>
		<p>“I’m from the north. I don’t know the name of the city,” she responded.</p>
		<p>Robert nodded several times as he responded in a straightforward manner, "That is the area where the urban warfare was fiercest. It must have been very difficult for you. This area was once occupied by enemy forces, but the Allies took it back soon after, so we didn’t suffer much damage. Fortunately, my family is all safe. Still... I’m sorry for those who lost their homes and are struggling.......”</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry for those who lost their homes and are struggling,” Natalia thought, “It’s more like.......”</p>
		<p>“Can you live in a human town?” Natalia asked frankly and suddenly.</p>
		<p>The old couple looked at each other, smiled, and nodded, "Of course.”</p>
		<p>“The people in the town seem to know that you are beastmen, is this correct?” Their smiles did not change when Shirou, who was drinking his tea in a surprisingly elegant manner, asked.</p>

		<p>“Yes," answered Robert. “They are aware of this and have accepted it. We are grateful for that.”</p>
		<p>Natalia knew of cases where people hide their true nature and settled in human towns, but this was the first time she had ever heard of a case like the Merry family. She glanced over at</p>
		<p>Shiro, but he didn’t seem surprised. From his point of view, this was nothing unusual.</p>
		<p>“Excuse me, but are you two siblings?” Robert asked.</p>
		<p>Natalia shook her head hurriedly, “No, we’re not. I was taken prisoner from my village by the humans. This man saved me.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, my God, I didn’t know that. That must have been hard for you. I’m glad you survived.”</p>
		<p>Robert lowered his eyebrows in deep sympathy, but did not ask any more questions. He wondered what had happened to the village after that, and why Natalia was with Shirou instead of with the villagers. He probably didn’t say anything about the situation because he assumed the worst, in order not to hurt her.</p>
		<p>The excessive consideration made Natalia a bit uncomfortable.</p>
		<p>In her mind she missed her hometown and its people very little. Even if everyone was safe and the village was rebuilt, she would still be ridiculed and have to live a stifling life back there. It’s not a lie that she wouldn’t have survived if Shirou hadn’t saved her, but the reason she is still attached to the Silver Wolf is not because she has a strong sense of purpose. She was looking for something, something that she needed to find. Natalia kept making excuses to herself in her mind, but Shiro didn’t say anything and just allowed her to stay quietly next to him. To him, if you want to find something, you have to ask.</p>
		<p>Believing in what the village chief had once told her, Natalia asked the next question to continue the conversation, “Do you and your family all share the same animal nature?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, we are goat-beasts,” responded Robert.</p>
		<p>Beasthood - that is the kind of animal one has the power to change into. For beastmen, this is just a topic of conversation as a form of greeting and is shared without prejudice or discrimination. The first thing that surprised Natalia when she was captured by the humans was how ignorant they were about beasts and beastmen. She knew that the beastmen are more ignorant. They have been avoiding human contact for a long time, so it is natural for them to be ignorant of the world. However, Natalia found it inexplicable that humanity, with its vast knowledge and wisdom, did not know even the most rudimentary things about beastmen.</p>
		<p>First of all, their biggest misconception was that beastmen were “not human.” They were surprised to find that they did not have multiple stomachs or extremely long intestines. This was ridiculous, she thought. All beastmen have been told from a young age that beastmen are human beings. They are another human race with origins in a different human genus than other humans, and have developed a different culture. That is what the beastmen are.</p>
		<p>During the course of their evolution, they acquired the power to change their bodies in order to get closer to the animal species that they worshipped as gods. This beastification is the reason why beastmen are called beastmen, but they are based on humans.</p>
		<p>“Goats are relatively mild-mannered, so I think they would get along well with humans.”</p>
		<p>Robert responds, “That’s true, of course. Of course, we take care not to bother people, but that’s what everyone in the town does. By the way, what about you?”</p>
		<p>“I’m a naked mole rat. Mr. Ogami is a wolf. And this is a crow.”</p>
		<p>“Kaa," Kuro greeted, spreading his wings to the delight of the baby who saw him.</p>
		<p>There was one more thing that the human scientists had got fundamentally wrong. That is, even if they have different animal characteristics - for example, a lion beastman and a gorilla beastman - they are still the same species. The main component of beastmen is the human component. No matter how diverse their beastly forms may be, beastmen are still a single species: beastmen.</p>
		<p>However, their personalities and temperaments often resemble those of the animals, whose form they take. This is because, in the beginning, beastmen wanted to look like the beasts they revered so much that they actually became them, so imitating their nature is already an instinct. This may have confused humanity even more.</p>
		<p>“With regards to what was said at the soup kitchen in the town square, are you all still okay?”</p>
		<p>Natalia posed the question again. The reason why Shirou didn’t interrupt this chatty conversation was because this was a part of the investigation. He would rescue them if he found out that they were in danger. That was the role of the Silver Wolf.</p>
		<p>“We're still okay," Robert said with a hint of weakness in his face, his gaze shifting, perhaps unconsciously, to his son and daughter-in-law and their baby.</p>
		<p>“We don’t have much, but I can pick wild vegetables in the mountains. Free food rations should be given to those who are really struggling.”</p>
		<p>“I think that’s a very noble idea,” responded Natalia.</p>
		<p>Just because they are goat beasts does not mean that they have the same diet as goats.</p>
		<p>There is no way that wild vegetables alone can provide all of their nourishment, and when she looks carefully, she can see that the faces of the Merry family are slightly gaunt. This kind of patience is probably necessary to live with humans, and yet there is a savior by their side who doesn’t even care about their sacrifice.</p>
		<p>“There is no need to care about humans. Put your own lives first.” Shirou spoke bluntly</p>

		<p>“Mr. Ogami......” Natalia said as she hurriedly thrust her elbow into his side, but it was too late.</p>
		<p>He was resentful and did not move an eyebrow. She wondered what he was thinking about.</p>
		<p>“That’s not very nice.......”</p>
		<p>The Merry family also had a slightly troubled expression on their faces. What would they look like if she told them that this man was the Messiah? The end of the legend would begin today.</p>
		<p>“At any rate, I’m sure you're both tired from your long journey,” Robert spoke, ”I can’t offer much, but at least you can stay here. There are not many places where a traveling beastman can rest in peace.......”</p>
		<p>“Oh, n-no......” Natalia stumbles.</p>
		<p>“No food, thank you, but water and a place to sleep would be much appreciated.” As Natalia hesitated, Shirou’s clear voice interrupted her. He did not burden the kind people with his words, but he was also very bold in his manner of speaking. His tone of voice and the exquisite balance of his request may indeed be the result of a thousand years of experience, she thought.</p>
		<p>Natalia, who hadn’t been able to sleep well in bed for a long time, listened to Robert talk about life in the town until noon the next day. She waited for the bell to ring for the soup kitchen, and then went out to the square. All of Robert’s stories were interesting: the history of the square, the harvest festival at a nearby farm, the music of the zither, and the story of how his grandfather came to be in the town. All of this resonated in Natalia’s mind more clearly than the words in the books she had read.</p>
		<p>In the square, a line formed in front of the store, just as it had done yesterday. She ate some of the stew she had received and then immediately handed the rest to Shirou.</p>
		<p>“You've barely eaten anything.”</p>
		<p>He may have thought she was concerned about him, but he seemed slightly unhappy to her.</p>
		<p>Her body does not regulate its temperature very well due to her animal nature. As a result, she uses less energy and therefore consumes fewer calories. Picking up her warm, fur-lined cape, Natalia said, “I’ll leave it to you to keep me warm,” and looked around the square. The pair of ex-military men from yesterday had not arrived.</p>
		<p>She overheard the word “beastman” coming out of the conversation of the men sitting on the stairs nearby.</p>
		<p>“Yeah. Yes, I know. That’s Merry’s place, the chimney sweep. You know, the chimney sweeps, the ones who work for low wages without complaining?”</p>

		<p>Apparently, they were acquainted with Robert’s son.</p>
		<p>“That house just had a baby, so life must be hard for them, right? Why don’t they come to the square for food?”</p>
		<p>“Well? I wonder why?</p>
		<p>The tone of the conversation dropped.</p>
		<p>“Maybe he’s been storing food in his house without telling us? See, he’s a beast, right? Maybe he’s transforming into an animal and is stealing from the fields to avoid detection.......”</p>
		<p>“No way. He’s a good guy.”</p>
		<p>“I don’t know, man. I don’t know,” he said. "Right now, there’s a lot of livestock outside of town that escaped from the farmers. If there’s a little damage, they'll think it’s their fault. I’ll think it’s their fault.......”</p>
		<p>Natalia lost her temper and tried to talk back to the men. The Merry family is suffering, but they have endured not coming to the soup kitchen for the sake of the people of the town. It was a one-sided conversation made behind their backs. However, a large hand clamped down on her shoulder as she tried to lean forward.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami…”</p>
		<p>The words she had almost spat out were left behind in the void, and Natalia gulped as she was pulled into Shirou’s shadow. He was looking cautiously towards the entrance of the square. The men who had just walked in were different from the townspeople.</p>
		<p>“......!”</p>
		<p>Natalia became aware of the change in the air. A swarthy atmosphere had surrounded them.</p>
		<p>A man yelled to the townspeople, “Is there anyone in this town who has been involved with the enemy? If you know of anyone who has made a fortune trading with the enemy, women who have slept with enemy men, or any other shameless person who has tried to survive by flattering the enemy, please let us know!”</p>
		<p>It’s “The Banishment Movement” Natalia gulped again as she remembered who they were, from a city they had passed through earlier. She felt her low body temperature drop even further. To put it simply, what they were doing was revenge against those who had been involved with the enemy. As if to make an example of them, they ripped off their clothes in public, shouted abuse at them, and then beat and kicked them. What was frightening was that the people who had lived with the beaten only a few days prior, joined in with their horrible looks. Those who tried to stop them were beaten mercilessly. It was as if the madness of the war, which had been barely contained until then, had burst forth all at once.</p>
		<p>It may have been a punishment that should have been carried out based on proper rules.</p>
		<p>However, in the small towns and villages where it was difficult to enforce these rules, the activities became more and more extreme and gruesome, and the meaning of revenge became stronger.</p>
		<p>“It’s better not to be seen. Keep quiet,” ordered Shirou.</p>
		<p>Even as he removed his hand from her shoulder, Natalia’s body could not move from Shirou’s shadow. She was afraid of the people who were changing.</p>
		<p>“This place was only occupied for a short time, and the enemy went away while we stayed indoors.” A jovial man shouted to dispel the tense atmosphere. The other residents looked at each other for a moment, then nodded in agreement. The air was slightly relaxed, but the men of the “Banishment Movement” seemed unhappy.</p>
		<p>The man from the town who spoke up first said, "you can’t tell me it’s all the people living here?”</p>
		<p>“Then what about the strangers? In this day and age, you wouldn’t know if some criminal had infiltrated your town. In other towns, there have been thugs hiding in the streets pretending to be veterans!”</p>
		<p>“They've changed their target,” Shirou murmurs in annoyance.</p>
		<p>This is always the case. Their bloodshot eyes were filled with the will to attack and eliminate anyone they could. From her point of view, this is the main reason why the "Banishment</p>
		<p>Movement" looked so creepy and vile to Natalia. Natalia could feel the air in the square changing slightly. The skin of the naked mole rat was sensitive. Although she could not display this sensitivity in her human form, she could sense the similarities.</p>
		<p>“Strangers......”</p>
		<p>“A dangerous man: ......”</p>
		<p>Slowly but surely, the air in the square began to drift towards hysteria. The discourse of the men of the “Banishment Movement” was shifting from “get rid of the traitors” to "get rid of the untrustworthy strangers". And yet, no one is arguing with them anymore. They want a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will make them feel a little safer.......</p>
		<p>The eyes of the people gathered in the square began to search each other as if thinking,</p>
		<p>“I’m not sure if there’s anyone I don’t know. Is there anyone you don’t know or trust?”</p>
		<p>“If I can’t trust them, even a little bit, I want to get rid of them while I can.”</p>

		<p>Without even looking at her, Shirou took Natalia’s arm and left the square without a sound, quite naturally. He moved like a panther leaping from darkness to darkness, rather than the paw of a wolf in pursuit of its prey.</p>
		<p>“The beastmen will be targeted,” Shirou told her plainly as he moved toward the Merry family’s place of residence. Natalia had a hunch, too.</p>
		<p>Natalia protested, “I’ll try to persuade them somehow ....... There is nothing wrong with Robert and his family. If we talk to them, they will ......”</p>
		<p>“Do they look like they’ll understand you? The Merry’s will be mobbed soon. We have to get the family to safety,” snapped Shirou.</p>
		<p>It was unreasonable. Why should the beastmen be attacked when it was the humans who started the war and invaded this town? Natalia heard the sound of a zither coming from somewhere. It was not the gentle melody of yesterday, but a sound that stirred up anxiety and commotion. She didn’t want to hear such a sound. They arrived at the house of the Merry family. They had no idea what was going on and were having a peaceful time. It was true, they could not be blamed for anything.</p>
		<p>“Hello, Natalia. Welcome back, Mr. Ogami. What’s up with ......?” Robert sensed that something was wrong and asked curiously.</p>
		<p>“Robert, do you have your family all together?” Asked Shirou.</p>
		<p>“What? Huh,.......” He nodded back, confused, but his face went completely rigid as Shirou continued.</p>
		<p>“The town’s people are after you. You'd better get out of here right now.”</p>
		<p>“No, why?” It was Robert’s only son who raised his voice in grief. It was fortunate that he had just returned home for his lunch break.</p>
		<p>“Some people who want to return the war to its former glory are stirring up the townspeople to find a convenient target. I’m sorry, but you've got to give up on the furniture. Is there someplace we can take shelter?” Asked Shirou.</p>
		<p>“No, no, no, no, no, no. We've been living here alone as a family for a long time.......”</p>
		<p>“Then I’ll accompany you to someplace safe. Don’t worry, I will save the beastman.”</p>
		<p>With a voice that was more powerful than words, the Merry family seemed to finally realize that this was not a mistake.</p>
		<p>But.</p>

		<p>“I’m sorry, but we can’t go.” The old Robert and his wife turned to Shirou with a dejected voice.</p>
		<p>“My wife has a bad leg and I cannot run as fast as she can.”</p>
		<p>Natalia knew immediately what he meant: he was suggesting that the entrance to the town might be fortified by humans. They wanted the group to leave them behind because they didn’t think they could get through. They know what fate awaits them if they stay.</p>
		<p>“If we beat them all up, it won’t be a problem. Let’s go,” said Shirou flatly.</p>
		<p>“Wait, Mr. Ogami. That will irritate them even more. They might follow us even if we leave the city. That will only increase the danger.” Natalia, repulsed by Shirou’s wild idea, turned her face away from his disgruntled gaze and pondered for a moment. There must be a way to get the Merry family out safely. How to get out of town without hurting the humans and without being noticed....... What circumstances are available? What knowledge is available? Then, she had a flash of inspiration.</p>
		<p>Natalia quickly turned her head and asked Shirou, “Mr. Ogami, do you know how to be a sheepdog?”</p>
		<p>As the sun was setting, the town, which had been peaceful until late afternoon, was enveloped in a damp, soggy atmosphere. Many houses, not wanting to be associated with each other, dropped their armored doors on their windows or turned off their lights to keep their distance from the street. In the streets, men with lumber, fire sticks, and even hunting rifles walked about with a mixture of aggression and anxiety in their faces.</p>
		<p>“All we have to do is get the dangerous man out of town. This was self-defense. This is self-defense," said the leader, naming his action as a “decision,” an excuse to protect himself and his dignity. ”We just have to get rid of the beastmen.” The weapon was only to scare them. No harm done.”</p>
		<p>That’s what all of them were thinking, but a small number of people - and that’s enough could tell by their body language that they were clutching their weapons for a more gruesome purpose.</p>
		<p>“Kill the beastmen.” Those few know that the sound of a single shot will send the crowd into a state of excitement, and they will brandish their weapons.</p>
		<p>“I won’t let you,” thought Natalia.</p>
		<p>Having read their vicious thoughts, Shirou unleashed his own beastliness inside his worn-out cloak.</p>
		<p>Beastification.</p>
		<p>Gray hair swelled from the skin all over his body, his mouth split open up to his ears, and his twenty-eight healthy teeth were transformed into forty-two sharp blades.</p>
		<p>The upper limit of the power generated by his four limbs skyrocketed, making the chimney of the house he was resting his hand on, feel as fragile as sandwork. His sense of smell had become so acute that he could assign name tags to every resident in the town and still have time to identify them.</p>
		<p>Feeling more satisfied than uncomfortable that his nose was now so far ahead of his gaze, Shirou pulled his hood over his head and called out loudly to the crowd from on top of the roof. “The beastmen have escaped!”</p>
		<p>At the same time as the humans cringed, five goats raced down the main street of the town.</p>
		<p>“Baaaahhh.......”</p>
		<p>Natalia shuddered as she heard a wave of angry shouts that sounded like cheers coming from outside the Merry house. It had begun. It was not like the town festivals that the people traditionally held. They were driving the beastmen away in a kind of man-hunting rampage.</p>
		<p>“Let’s go,” Natalia turned around in front of the door and looked around quickly at the faces of the five members of the Merry family behind her, who nodded back at her, before gently opening the door. There was no sign of life outside the house, and the crowd was roaring far away, like the rumbling of the earth. This way, they could get out of town without anyone seeing them. Natalia let out a small smile through her nervousness. It worked. The five goats were decoys. They had been caught by Shirou in secret from the semi-wild area outside the town. They were then released into the town at once for the humans to chase. Natalia remembered Shirou’s reaction when she had suggested this.</p>
		<p>“H-How dare you treat me like a sheepdog?!” Shirou exclaimed.</p>
		<p>The look on his face was one of mockery and indignation at the lack of respect for the legendary silver wolf.</p>
		<p>Natalia thought to herself that certainly, this was not a job for a beastly savior. A more solemn and overwhelming act would be more appropriate for a god.</p>
		<p>Shirou pondered silently, “......,” then said with a very smug look on his face. “I’m actually very good at that. If you want, I can run through every street in this town in one stroke.”</p>
		<p>“No, thanks. No, thanks. Just follow the directions I give you.”</p>
		<p>“Ehhh......” Shirou hesitates.</p>
		<p>“I've never seen that face before. Do you really want to do this?” Natalia asks.</p>
		<p>“No, it’s .......” Shirou pauses.</p>
		<p>“What? You have an incredibly disappointed look on your face.” Natalia asks again.</p>
		<p>Well, it worked, and with a face like that, the goats seemed to be well guided and it was totally helped by the ignorance of the humans this time. A beastman is not a perfect beast.</p>
		<p>They can only be a mixture of human and animal. However, the only people who knew this were the scientists who were at the beast camp, which stirred complicated feelings in Natalia.</p>
		<p>The people of this town didn’t know enough about beastmen to not believe the ridiculous stories about the Merry family turning into goats and raiding the fields. There is only one person in the world who can completely turn into a beast. Oddly enough, that is the Silver</p>
		<p>Wolf. He is the only one in the world who can become a complete beast.</p>
		<p>There was no one else in the alleyway where Natalia was leading the family. She thought that</p>
		<p>Shirou must be driving the goats around to draw away the people who had been blocking the entrances of the town. In the end, the plan was for the goats to escape from the town, giving the illusion that the Merry family had completely escaped. Then, the plan was to leave from the other side of the town while the goats had everybody’s attention.</p>
		<p>“Calm down. There’s no need to panic.”</p>
		<p>Natalia turned around and checked to see if the family was still with her. Everyone was safe.</p>
		<p>There was only one more corner to turn. If they turned that corner, they would be able to see the exit.</p>
		<p>But...</p>
		<p>“There you are......”</p>
		<p>Natalia knew instantly that she was looking into the eyes of her strained opponent.</p>
		<p>“Grandmother…” said the voice.</p>
		<p>It was familiar. It was the woman from the store in the square who had served Natalia a large bowl of stew. Natalia was speechless. If the woman shouted out, some of the crowd chasing the goats might hear her and come running to their location. What would she do?</p>
		<p>Immediately after her body stiffened with hesitation, which was fatal in itself, Natalia saw the woman in front of her look around and make a small wave towards her.</p>
		<p>“What are you standing there for? Why are you standing still?”</p>
		<p>Natalia was surprised, but there was no time to pursue the matter further. She slipped by the woman’s side.</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry, grandmother. I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help.......” Natalia heard the woman say in a distressed voice to Robert’s old wife, whom her son was carrying.</p>
		<p>“It’s okay. Thank you for everything. Take care.” The old woman replied in a voice as gentle as a sunbeam as they walked past her.</p>
		<p>Natalia thought to herself. She let them go. She was human, but she was on the side of the beastmen. She can’t say that she would have wanted the woman to stop the crowd. They must have been afraid that if they were to interfere in any way, they would be beaten to a pulp on the spot. It was dangerous to even witness the escape.</p>
		<p>“Why?......” Natalia thought.</p>
		<p>She wondered why the Merry family had to leave this town when there were people like them. Why can’t beastmen live with humans? Without even the faintest hint of an answer to the questions that had arisen, Natalia and the family escaped from the town. After evacuating the family to a nearby forest, Natalia left Kuro to take care of them and went back to the town to get Shirou. It was hard to believe that he was still running around town, but since he hadn’t shown up at the rendezvous time, she had no choice but to go look for him.</p>
		<p>Natalia alone would not be able to protect the family in case something happened.</p>
		<p>There was no sign of anyone at the entrance to the town and no sounds of disturbance inside.</p>
		<p>Had the goats had also managed to escape ......? From the shadows, Natalia quietly peered into the town.</p>
		<p>“Don’t move.”</p>
		<p>She heard a voice from behind her, and her heart leapt.</p>
		<p>“Turn around slowly with your hands in the air.”</p>
		<p>She did as she was told, raised her hands and turned around. There he was, with a sickly expression on his face and a gun at his side, the man from the Banishment Movement.</p>
		<p>Natalia’s mind went completely blank. Her knees trembled, and she almost collapsed on the spot. She knew though, if she made such a big move, the man in front of her would easily pull the trigger. She was scared.</p>
		<p>“What are you, a child? Are you a kid?” The man asked, sounding a little relieved.</p>
		<p>She should have nodded. She should have nodded and said that she was a kid from the town.</p>
		<p>She could still fake it. Her normal self would have been able to think of something like that, but she couldn’t. She was terrified. The man in front of her looked just like those scientists.</p>
		<p>No matter how many times she begged and cried, she thought, they would not forgive her for anything, and he was just as cruel as those scientists.</p>
		<p>“Why don’t you tell me? Are you one of the beastmen of this town?”</p>

		<p>He assumed her silence was an affirmation and grabbed her by the arm, as he took her into the town.</p>
		<p>“I’ll check with the people in town. If you're one of them, you'd better be prepared, okay?”</p>
		<p>Instantly. The man with the lecherous smile on his face faded into the darkness.</p>
		<p>“What are you prepared to do?...”</p>
		<p>Just as she thought she heard the snarl of a ferocious beast; Natalia’s arm was released as if she had been pushed away. On the other hand, the flapping feet of the man caught in midair grazed her nose, and she blinked. The man’s head was grabbed and fished up with one hand by a gray wolf named Shirou.</p>
		<p>“Bah, monster!” The man tried to pull a gun on him, but Shirou didn’t show the slightest bit of agitation and knocked the man’s gun away with his hand, as if he were brushing off an insect.</p>
		<p>“Tell me what she needs to prepare herself for!” Shirou, snarls.</p>
		<p>“AAAAAAH!”</p>
		<p>Shirou’s face was close to the man’s, and his barking was that of a raging animal. Natalia was not sure if she was going to be able to do it, but she had to try.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami…” She called out, thinking he was going to kill this human. She thought he would kill him the same way he had indiscriminately killed every moving human in that beastman camp, but when he glanced at her for a moment, she saw a certain reason in his eyes.</p>
		<p>“Don’t forget," his voice tells her.</p>
		<p>“If you mess with the beastmen, the wolves will come. There won’t be a next time.”</p>
		<p>The man may have been trying to nod, but the motion did not carry over. After saying what he wanted to say, Shirou threw the man with one hand. The man jumped headfirst into the wall of a house, as if it were a joke, and was pierced with a powerful thud that reduced his height by several centimeters, before falling into a long, deep sleep.</p>
		<p>“Are you alright, Natalia?” asked Shirou.</p>
		<p>“Yes, ........ Thank you.”</p>
		<p>When he turned around, Shirou had already returned to his human form.</p>
		<p>“You didn’t turn into the silver wolf?” she asks.</p>
		<p>In response to Natalia’s question, Shirou turned his head down and mumbled, “I will not become the Silver Wolf anymore.” It would be a long time before Natalia would know the true meaning of his words. For now, she just interpreted that he did not need the power of the</p>
		<p>Silver Wolf to beat this human.</p>
		<p>Shirou asks her, “What happened to the family?”</p>
		<p>“'They're all safe, and waiting in the forest with Kuro, as planned.”</p>
		<p>“Well, that’s good. I remembered that there is a hidden village of beastmen a little farther west. They should be able to welcome them there.”</p>
		<p>“Are you sure? Thank God.......!”</p>
		<p>“Yeah, really.......”</p>
		<p>She was not proud of helping others, but as Shirou’s stern brow relaxed with relief, Natalia felt a small warmth light up in her heart. He may be a stubborn, eccentric, and insensitive representative of beastmen, but his desire to help the beastmen is more sincere and genuine than anyone else’s. Natalia still hadn’t figured out what she wanted to do in this big world, but for now, she will help him.</p>
		<p>“Let’s help the beastmen who are suffering.”</p>
		<p>It was the right thing to do, Natalia thought, and she wanted to do it.</p>
