	<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>he view of the city from the window of the mayor’s office was different from any other city she had ever seen. The paperwork had already reached a level of busyness beyond what could be called hard work, but it was only now that the city spread out behind the glass would officially come to life.</p>
		<p>Anima City, a city of beastmen. It was the night before the opening ceremonies. Even though the streets around the city hall had already been developed, there was still major construction going on day and night in the distance. Even after the migrants arrive tomorrow, the beastmen will continue to build the city before their eyes.</p>
		<p><i>A continuation….</i></p>
		<p>Yes. This is not the end, and it is not the beginning. It’s a continuation. A continuation of something that started a long time ago. It’s just like one of those times. The woman looked at her reflection in the glass window, and felt a slight sense of satisfaction in the dull eyes that seemed to be starting to resemble his. These were not the eyes of someone who was dulled by pain. They were the eyes of someone who had been hurt and was still fighting back.</p>
		<p>She heard someone standing in front of the door of the mayor’s office. The air was calm and serene, a step or two removed from the hustle and bustle of the immigration officials downstairs, who were busy with the paperwork.</p>
		<p>She giggled at the hesitant flicker of hesitation, and immediately threw a “please” towards the direction of the door.</p>
		<p>He walks in.</p>
		<p>He is a very private person, neither the receptionist nor her secretary, Ishizaki, accompanied him. She calls out his name.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami.”</p>
		<p>He gave a small “hello” and looked around the mayor’s office a little absent–mindedly. There was a desk and a reception area separated by a partition. There were pictures of the people who had worked so hard to establish the city, as well as some of her teachers and mentors that she would never forget. There was also a perch for Kuro.</p>
		<p>Finally, he smiled quietly as he looked at the night time scene that had just begun to unfold behind her.</p>
		<p>“I’ve lost, Natalia. I never thought you would be building a city of beastmen, let alone a school.”</p>
		<p>“I now go by the name of Barballet Rosé.” Rosé shrugged and smiled back as she relaxed a little.</p>
		<p>“Savagery and fraternity, civilization and wilderness, intensity and serenity, and many other things come together to create something new. That’s what this name means.”</p>
		<p>“Did you cut your hair?”</p>
		<p>If a stranger had asked her that, she would probably be stunned to hear that as the second thing said to her after reuniting for the first time in decades, but to Rosé, it was a question with meaning and significance. She stroked her scalp where not a single hair was growing.</p>
		<p>“Yes. When I meet people, I can make my position clearer if I′m in beast form....... It would be more difficult to clean up the hair if I had to scatter it every time I met someone.”</p>
		<p>“I thought you weren’t too fond of your beast form.” Shirou asked a little awkwardly, and Rosé rolled her eyes slightly.</p>
		<p>“You noticed that?”</p>
		<p>“Well, it was a long journey.”</p>
		<p>His joking tone of voice was unusual for him, and she felt a flicker of youthfulness in her heart as she realized that this was a sign of familiarity.</p>
		<p>“In addition, you’ve got wrinkles between your eyes. Relax a little more.”</p>
		<p>“I don’t need you to tell me what to do.”</p>
		<p>They both took playful shots at each other.</p>
		<p>“....This is who I am now.” Rosé stood her small body upright as much as she could and looked at Shirou.</p>
		<p>He narrowed his eyes and loosened his mouth. “You’re getting stronger. You were such a helpless little girl.”</p>
		<p>He glanced at the doctorate certificates and trophies from various research presentations displayed on a shelf in the corner of the room. “Everywhere I went, I heard about you.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, it’s not unusual to see you on TV, but in the early days, everyone was glued to the screen. You were the star of hope for all beastmen. No, ...... you became the star of hope.”</p>
		<p>There are beastmen who live quietly in human cities, beastmen who live a traditional life in the forest, beastmen who live strong in the darkness of the city, and beastmen who continue to look forward despite persecution. She began to wonder if they all thought the same thing.</p>
		<p><i>No, don’t do that.</i></p>
		<p>She reiterated in her heart that they did. The many letters she received were proof of that. The goat beastmen, tiger beastmen, black panthers, bears, rhinos, cheetahs, dolphins, and beavers all cheered her on.</p>
		<p>She says, half–turning her body and looking down at the city with one side of her face, “It is only with the cooperation of many people that we can do this. In this Anima City, we can give the beastmen time and space. The beastmen can learn about the world and accept the world gracefully.”</p>
		<p>She was a little afraid of what he would say next. Would he still spit out, “I don’t need to learn about humans,” or would he just walk out without a word?</p>
		<p>The hands behind her back trembled slightly. She mocked herself for not being able to face</p>
		<p>Shirou squarely in the eyes. It was as if she were on guard. Even though she had withstood all kinds of negative voices until today, she was afraid of only one person. She was afraid of Shirou</p>
		<p>Ogami’s reply. Then he said something she never thought he would say.</p>
		<p>“I want to help too.” Those were his words.</p>
		<p>“What…...!?”</p>
		<p>As if she had been hit by a bullet, Rosé immediately turned towards Shirou.</p>
		<p>“The legendary silver wolf is lending his power over to me and this city?” The reason why she stated it a bit indirectly was because if she didn’t, she felt she would have lost her dignity as the head of the city in an instant and would have jumped out of her skin. Dignity is very important for a beastman.</p>
		<p>“I′m just a beastman, that is all,” he chuckled. “Anima City is a place where beastmen can live without being threatened by humans. There’s no place like it anywhere else in the world. I want to protect this place. I want to protect it this time.”</p>
		<p><i>Is it Nirvasyl or Wakhan Taluka in his clenched fist?</i> Rosé wondered.</p>
		<p>Regardless, this was a very, very important development.</p>
		<p>“It will be so reassuring to have you here, Mr. Ogami. You’ve guided so many beastmen in the pa–.”</p>
		<p>When she looked back at him expectantly, he lifted his hand in a small gesture to stifle Rosé’s words. “I told you. I′m just a wolf beastman. You’re the one who’s supposed to lead us in this town. Wolves obey their boss. You know that, right?”</p>
		<p>“......Yes, I do.”</p>
		<p>She shook her head slightly, realizing her weakness in trying to rely on him again without realizing it, but she kept those feelings to herself. For a while, she looked at him with a gentle, clever gaze, as if he were the only friend she had ever known.</p>
		<p>“Well I look forward to working with you, Special Advisor.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, ma’am, Mayor Barballet Rosé.”</p>
		<p>Clear air and tension had flowed between them, but then slowly melted into smiles. Tomorrow, Anima City will begin. At present, there are 80,000 people who wish to move to the city. This number is expected to grow as the city’s reputation spreads. The United Nations has acknowledged the existence of the beastmen in a statement, letting the world know that “they have always been here.” However, the appearance of these new, internationally recognized inhabitants will cause a major disturbance in the existing world order. The rights and obligations of the new inhabitants, as well as the treatment of migratory bird beastmen that do not belong to any one country, will be discussed.......</p>
		<p>Although their existence has been recognized by far more people than before, beastmen are still persecuted all over the world and have nowhere to go and nowhere to live. The beastmen need help now more than ever, to live with everyone and survive as members of this world.</p>
		<p>Hopefully, Anima City will become a second home for many beastmen – and for their only savior of the wounded and weary – a place where he can heal his heartbreak and anger. This was the only wish of the girl who was once called Natalia.</p>
		<p>End.</p>
