	<h1 class="heading">Chapter 2 – The Beast Is Coming To Town</h1>

	<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>here was no doubt that a fierce battle had taken place here. The roads were cut off by craters that looked as if they had been gouged out cleanly with a spoon, and in the fields on either side of the road, the scorch marks of war could be clearly seen branded into the withered crops. A car, abandoned on the shoulder of the road, looked like a shell with most of its parts missing, and the smell of burning clung to her nose as she walked by.</p>
		<p>Natalia lifted her eyes from the pieces of iron scattered on the ground and set her sites on the city in the distance. Even from a distance, she could see that this small city was in ruins, and although there was no black smoke, she could easily imagine that it was overflowing with people who were devastated by the loss of their homes, possessions, and loved ones. She wondered what kind of life they were leading there now, and if there were any beastmen there.</p>
		<p>“Hey! Look, look, look! These are foreign cigarettes, cigarettes! If you don’t buy them now, you’ll never get them!</p>
		<p>“Hey there, Mister! How about some berries? Berries are good for smoky eyes. I promise you, so you can be sure!”</p>
		<p>“What, no money, no job? We don’t have those either! I’m offering you doughnuts and coffee, so eat up and cheer up a little!”</p>
		<p>Not only Natalia, but Shirou was also taken aback by the energy of the residents. Even if one discounted the fact that this was a market, the peoples’ faces were full of life. As they looked around the city, it was clear that all of the streets were covered with rubble and debris. Even the remaining houses were stained with soot and had broken windows. It took an hour just to find an intact building.</p>
		<p>On the main street, there were charred cars and what looked like tanks lying around, not even a scab on the scars of war. However, when they looked closely, they could see that in the pile of rubble, small children were happily digging up and collecting bricks that they could use, as if they had been given small errands to run. Trucks loaded with crates of what appeared to be reconstruction equipment were driving nimbly around the cracked roads. The faces of the people on the street were light with anxiety, and even the laundry hanging in the windows of the apartments seemed to be fluttering with strength. It was blown away while Natalia was looking at it.</p>
		<p>“There is something unusually cheerful here......,” commented Natalia.</p>
		<p>“Kaa......” replied Kuro, who had been perched on top of Natalia’s head for some time, in complete amusement.</p>
		<p>“You think they’ve lost their minds after all this mess?”</p>
		<p>“No way,” responded, Natalia, to Shirou’s rude comment, sighing as she followed, with her eyes, a boy running towards her with a wooden box of lemons. “They wouldn’t look like that if they had lost something.”</p>
		<p>Suddenly.</p>
		<p>“Whoa there, Mister. Yes you, Mister.”</p>
		<p>When Natalia turned around at the sound of his voice, she saw a suspicious-looking man standing there with a small box under his arm and a familiar smile on his face.</p>
		<p>“Me?” Shirou asked annoyed, as the man replied.</p>
		<p>“Yes. I’ve been calling out to you for a while now, but you haven’t turned around at all,” the man said as he came closer.</p>
		<p>“Don’t you want a cigarette, Mister? It’s a valuable commodity, you know. Oh, you don’t look like you need it. Then what about alcohol? I can’t say it out loud, but it’s Bavarian. I can’t say it out loud, but it’s Bavarian....... The enemies left it behind when they ran away.......”</p>
		<p>Even without looking at the inconsistent products coming out of the crates, Natalia realized that the man was a black marketeer. He was not a legitimate merchant, but a citizen who had purchased diverted military supplies, or in some cases stolen goods, and was now taking advantage of the shortage to conduct their business secretly and without permission.</p>
		<p>“How about a watch?” and then, “I’ve got a coat, too,” he said, turning up the collar of his outer cloak to show the wool on the inside, in the style of a typical black marketeer who carries all his goods and wealth with him. He even had Rosé wine.</p>
		<p>“How about this for you, young lady? Lipstick.”</p>
		<p>“Lipstick......?” responded Natalia.</p>
		<p>Shifting his focus to Natalia, who was paying a little more attention to the product than the silent Shirou, the man took off the cap of the case with his hand and showed her the contents.</p>
		<p>“Wow.......”</p>
		<p>The pretty peach color attracted Natalia’s attention. In her hometown, it was rare for beasts to wear make-up, but from the books in the village chief’s house, she knew that humans used a variety of cosmetics on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>As a girl who admired human culture, Natalia was naturally interested in such things. She was not interested in the primary colors that looked like they were squeezed out of wild berries, but the more subtle and pale colors. She wondered how they could create such beautiful colors. It reminded her of a picture of a sophisticated woman in an old magazine she saw at the village chief’s house. She wanted to try using such a thing for once.</p>
		<p>“It’s only been used a little bit, I think. Heh, what do you think, little girl?</p>
		<p>“Stop,” commanded Shirou.</p>
		<p>When Natalia’s hand was slightly extended, Shirou’s voice came down from above and stopped her. She looked up at him and saw that he was not talking to her, but to the black marketeer.</p>
		<p>“Do we look like we have the money? Get the hell out of here.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, I didn’t know that. I thought anyone who would carry a crow on their head in this day and age would either be dead or be someone very special, but I guess I was wrong.”</p>
		<p>The man suddenly became brusque. “If you’re not a customer, you’re out of love,” he said, but Natalia didn’t feel any ill will, probably because he was a good-natured person at heart.</p>
		<p>She knew that she should leave immediately before he realized that she was a beastman, but there was something she really wanted to ask, so she spoke up.</p>
		<p>“Um, Mister. Why are the people here so cheerful? The city is such a wreck.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, about that,” he said as the man put one of the cigarettes that had been for sale earlier in his mouth and lit it with a scarred lighter that looked like it would be very hard to sell.</p>
		<p>Someone’s initials were engraved on it, but they were hidden by scratches, making them unreadable.</p>
		<p>The man continued, “It is true, the enemy occupied the city, dropped bombs and left tanks all over the place, but each time we ran for cover in the nearby forest – you can see it from here. That big forest. That’s why there were so few deaths. As a result not many people are grieving, so everyone is in good spirits.”</p>
		<p>“In the forest? Is that all that saved you?”</p>
		<p>“W-Well, we escaped pretty far into the woods.”</p>
		<p>The man’s voice sounded slightly like he was avoiding answering. Natalia questioned him more, becoming more curious.</p>
		<p>“That forest looks very rugged, even from here, and it must have been very cold. Wouldn’t it have been more dangerous if you had run deeper?</p>
		<p>The man growled a little, frowned, and exhaled deeply from his cigarette.</p>
		<p>“You may not have any money, but I guess you’re not normal after all. Yeah, that’s right. If a large number of people had fled deep into the forest, there would have been a lot of lost people and children. ...... They saved us at that time.”</p>
		<p>“Who did?” asked Natalia.</p>
		<p>“The beastmen.”</p>
		<p>Natalia and Shirou looked at each other in surprise.</p>
		<p>“There is a village of beastmen deep in the forest, which some of the people in the city, especially the old people, know about. That’s why even the hunters don’t go in there any more than they have to, it’s taboo, but with the air strikes........ hiding at the entrance of the forest was not enough to make people feel safe. They had to run deeper into the forest. If anyone who is not familiar with the forest does that, of course they will get lost. When they were shivering in the cold and resigned to the fact that they had no choice but to die, they suddenly ran into people. The beastmen.”</p>
		<p>The man’s voice was a little strained, as if he’d seen it all before, but it also had a hint of gratitude in it. Perhaps he was one of the ones who had gotten lost.</p>
		<p>“I was surprised. I was expecting them to look like beasts on two legs, but in fact, they look just like humans. They can shapeshift, you know, just like the legendary werewolves. After we evacuated, they started to help us, and the people around here survived the war almost unscathed.......”</p>
		<p>“By any chance, do the people here still interact with beastmen?” Natalia asked hopefully.</p>
		<p>The man looked more bitter than the cigarette smoke he puffed and murmured, “You’ve got to be kidding. Who would want to be with those people?”</p>
		<p>Before Natalia could ask him what he meant, the black marketeer quickly packed up his goods and hurried away.</p>
		<p>“You ungrateful bastard,” Shirou snorted in annoyance, but Natalia suspected that there was more to it than that. She could see the black marketeer’s back as he slipped into the crowd, looking smaller in the distance as he moved further away from where they were standing.</p>
		<p>Suddenly.</p>
		<p>“Are you beastmen?” Surprised by the abrupt, swashbuckling remark, Natalia turned toward the voice as if she had been exposed.</p>
		<p>A large man with short, uneven hair was standing there. His chin was rounded, but his eyes were sharp and his lips were thick, giving him a somewhat oppressive look. The brown jacket he was wearing was new and looked to be two digits more expensive than Shirou’s faded cloak.</p>
		<p>“I knew it. You’re both beastmen.”</p>
		<p>The man’s face smiled, its roughness as if he were the embodiment of wildness itself.</p>
		<p>How did you notice us? Natalia thought.</p>
		<p>Her heart was beating uneasily in her chest. Although the black marketeer’s words were not the whole story, the position of the beastman was always in danger. She didn’t know what the humans would do to them if they found out.</p>
		<p>“Are you a beastman too?” When Shirou asked, he received a strong answer.</p>
		<p>“Yes!”</p>
		<p>“Oh,.......”</p>
		<p>Natalia was appalled, but at the same time she realized how panicked she had been.</p>
		<p>Beastmen have their own unique smell. Humans can’t distinguish the smell, but beastmen can recognize it, even if the beastman in question is in their human form.</p>
		<p>That’s how the man identified them, and that is why Natalia should have noticed him in the first place.</p>
		<p>“My name is Garte. I haven’t seen your faces around here, are you traveling?”</p>
		<p>“Well, something like that.”</p>
		<p>Seeing Shirou calmly interacting with him, Natalia was very glad that he was there with her.</p>
		<p>This man, Garte, was very similar to the beastmen in Natalia’s hometown. They were rough, crass, a pain in the ass, and they always tried to solve things with brute force. Suddenly asking such a question like that in human land? It was the height of insensitivity.</p>
		<p>However, she was curious that a beastman was walking around so openly in such a place.</p>
		<p>She had thought the black marketeer meant what he said earlier, that the beastmen and this city didn’t interact with the humans anymore.......</p>
		<p>Suddenly, at that moment, Natalia’s stomach rumbled loudly. She blushed and held her stomach, but Garte’s explosive laughter told her that it was no use.</p>
		<p>“If you’re hungry, I’ll feed you good food. Come with me.”</p>
		<p>Natalia and Shirou looked at each other and then followed him as he walked through the bustling streets of the market. Garte was completely unconcerned about the flow of people coming towards him, and proceeded to push them back.</p>
		<p>Natalia had a bad feeling at this point, as she saw some people scowling in annoyance, and others who were about to open their mouths to complain, distorting their mouths and running aside when they saw Garte’s face.</p>
		<p>Not long after, her bad feeling became a reality. Garte stopped in front of a fruit stand, snatched a colorful peach from a crate, and bit into it.</p>
		<p>“Yummy!”</p>
		<p>The sweet smell that spread from the bite reached her nose, but Natalia had no time to get drunk on it.</p>
		<p>“Hey, wait, how much is that!?”</p>
		<p>“What?”</p>
		<p>Looking down at Natalia curiously with a sideways glance, Garte completely ate up the peach in his second bite, licking the juice from his hand.</p>
		<p>“What’s the price? You guys should just eat. Today’s peaches are especially good.”</p>
		<p>Natalia was so shocked that she looked at the owner of the fruit shop. At first glance, the old human shopkeeper seemed to be smiling, but his cheeks and eyes looked unnatural, as if they were being pulled by an invisible thread.</p>
		<p>“Don’t you want it? It’s so good. “</p>
		<p>Natalia hurriedly stopped Garte from reaching for a second one.</p>
		<p>“Wait a minute. This is a place where you pay money to shop, you know!?” Natalia exclaimed.</p>
		<p>“So, what the hell is that?” responded Garte crassly.</p>
		<p>“Money, you know, is like what you give over there at....... This peach has a price, right? You see, the numbers on the wooden box. It’s.......” she tried to explain.</p>
		<p>“Oh, what a pain in the ass. Come on, there’s so many of them.”</p>
		<p>Natalia knew from her experience back home what was going through Garte’s narrow mind as he frowned in annoyance.</p>
		<p><i>I’m just taking a little.</i></p>
		<p>That was the extent of his understanding. He didn’t even have the common sense to know that you shouldn’t take something that belongs to someone else and make it your own.</p>
		<p>“The shopkeeper will get angry with us for doing that.”</p>
		<p>“Why don’t you just beat them up?” asked Garte.</p>
		<p>“It’s the 20<sup>th</sup> century!”</p>
		<p>However, to Natalia’s horror, such a century-old argument goes around every day among beastmen. If you are a beast, you are expected to defend your property to the death with your own strength or wisdom. As long as this shopkeeper doesn’t do that, the beastman will come to the ridiculous conclusion that it’s okay to do it.</p>
		<p>Good or bad, that is what common sense is to the beastmen. After pushing Garte out through the back of the market, Natalia ran back to the shopkeeper alone.</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry. Is this enough for that peach?”</p>
		<p>Natalia held out the only coin she had. It was the one that Kuro had found some time ago.</p>
		<p>The shopkeeper looked at her with surprise.</p>
		<p>“Are you sure, little crow girl?” asked the man.</p>
		<p>“I’m sure that guy has probably taken peaches from here many times before.......” responded Natalia.</p>
		<p>She thought a single coin was far from enough, but the shopkeeper smiled softly and accepted it.</p>
		<p>“Thank you. Your kindness is more than enough,” then he furrowed his brow in concern.</p>
		<p>“Are you going to be okay? You can’t treat that man like that. He’s a beastman.”</p>
		<p>“...... Yeah. I know.” Natalia replied bitterly, unable to honestly confess that she was also a beastman.</p>
		<p>“Is he from the forest?” she followed up.</p>
		<p>“Yes. During the war, he saved me many times.......” responded the shopkeeper.</p>
		<p>According to the owner, after the war, beastmen began to come down to the city. At first, the residents welcomed them as they had saved their lives, but as the savage behavior of the beastmen became clear, the residents’ relationship with them gradually became strained.</p>
		<p>The beastmen would not only eat and drink without paying, but also take clothes and reconstruction goods without permission, assault residents, and break things. There is a limit to the amount of lawlessness that people will tolerate, no matter how grateful they are.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, the city is clearly divided into two main groups: those who are angry at the beastmen and those who are frightened of them, and few people are grateful to them.</p>
		<p>“What an idiot.......” Natalia bemoaned as she covered her face with one hand.</p>
		<p>There was no exaggeration in what the shopkeeper had said, because Natalia knew this was how beastmen were every day.</p>
		<p>That pretentious jacket was probably taken from some store without permission. The worst part is that not only Garte, but probably all the other beastmen who came down to the city, are unaware that they are doing anything wrong.</p>
		<p>They take with force and refuse with force. They are convinced that the simple rules of the beastmen will work in human cities. It’s okay if it’s in their own village, especially since beastmen tend to gather together in similar animalistic groups. Large and strong beastmen like Garte are more likely to form a society that relies on their strength. However, this was not the case with humans.</p>
		<p>Natalia returned to Garte with a frown on her face. He was sitting on a crate, chatting with Shirou, and seemed to be puzzled as to why Natalia was screaming at him.</p>
		<p>Natalia turned to him again, “Listen, Mr. Garte, problems in human society can’t be solved entirely by brute force.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, yeah? If you’re strong, you’re...... great, right?”</p>
		<p>“That’s so foolish! People are in the same position whether they are strong or weak. You can’t take what belongs to your opponent without permission, and just because you’re strong doesn’t mean you can wield your power.”</p>
		<p>“Why? If you have power, that means you can use it, right?”</p>
		<p>“No, sir! Everyone sets rules and lives by them first and foremost! If you continue to be selfish like you are now, you and your village will be attacked one day! What are you going to do when that happens?”</p>
		<p>“Defeat them!” yelled Garte.</p>
		<p>“Stop it!” squeaked Natalia loudly and unintentionally in frustration.</p>
		<p>Natalia’s animalistic screech was met with a chuckle and smile from Garte, who covered his ears in response, “You’re a noisy little thing, aren’t you? What are you, a duckling or something?”</p>
		<p>“I’m a naked mole rat,” Natalia fumed.</p>
		<p>“So you’re a bald rat?”</p>
		<p>“I’m not bald! I’m naked!”</p>
		<p>When she shouted back at him, he waved his hand in front of her face as if he was trying to scare off an insect.</p>
		<p>“It doesn’t matter. That’s how we’ve always done it, and that’s how we’re going to do it. We’re not going to let anyone get in our way.”</p>
		<p>With that, he walked away with a carefree gait that did not signal any kind of reflection on his past actions at all.</p>
		<p>“I don’t know what to say…..” lamented Natalia.</p>
		<p>“All beastmen are like that.”</p>
		<p>Shirou spoke, As Natalia gritted her teeth.</p>
		<p>“A strong man can defend his territory. The one with the loudest voice can show himself off farther. The habits of the beasts that our ancestors revered are still alive in our hearts. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
		<p>“But ......” Natalia started.</p>
		<p>“I told him earlier to stay away from this city. As long as humans and beastmen live separately, there won’t be any problems. I don’t know if he’ll heed my words, though.”</p>
		<p>Was it really as simple as that?</p>
		<p>Natalia wondered if this silver wolf, who had lived for a thousand years, had properly grasped the current flow of the world. She could not discount the long years he had spent in this world, but she still felt that they were living in an unprecedented time where vague rules of intuition are useless.</p>
		<p>Through this war, the world has been stirred up like a pot of stew.</p>
		<p>People from different countries fought all over the world, and races and emotions got mixed up. The beastmen were caught up in it. Can they return to how things were? Natalia felt that It will be difficult for beastmen to keep their distance from humans going forward.</p>
		<p>And yet ......, she thought <i>Beastmen and humans have such different ways of thinking. What would happen to the beastmen, who are outnumbered, if the humans saw us purely as the enemy?</i></p>
		<p>Even if they continue to help the beastmen on a haphazard basis as they do now, they will never be able to keep up.</p>
		<p>“I’m going to go talk to that man again. I’ll go talk to him again and make sure he obeys the town’s rules,” declared Natalia.</p>
		<p>“Beastmen have their own rules, they don’t need to conform to humans.”</p>
		<p>Shirou’s words became tangled in her legs as Natalia started after the man, causing her to stop.</p>
		<p>“Are you on the side of the humans, by any chance?” Shirou asked.</p>
		<p>“It’s because humans are more...”</p>
		<p>As she was about to argue with him, the coldness of fresh water spread in her chest. It wasn’t because she felt fear at Shirou’s increasingly stern expression. It was because the color of the white coats of the scientists at the beast camp flickered in her mind.</p>
		<p>Humans are a more prosperous race than beastmen. They are more numerous, have more advanced technology, and have a more mature society. If contact with them could no longer be avoided, then the beastmen would have to adapt to the humans. However, humans are cruel and brutal. They captured and killed a lot of beastmen. Beastmen would not have done such a cruel thing. Beastmen are violent, but they don’t kill needlessly. There is no need to emulate humans........</p>
		<p>Why......?, Natalia shook her head weakly.</p>
		<p>Her anger and hatred were interfering with her normal thinking.</p>
		<p>She should have been able to think better and find a more honest way to deal with the situation, but the memories of pain and anger prevented her from doing so. Before she knew it, Natalia was standing on her haunches, breathing darkly under the weight of her own body, and wondering if this was how Shirou, the Silver Wolf, felt.</p>
		<p>A thousand years of accumulated memories and emotions, rejecting humans and everything they have created, while Natalia was trying to be like them.</p>
		<p>Garte’s back was no longer visible in the crowd, and Natalia’s blurred vision could only see the flow of people that he had pushed aside slowly returning to normal.</p>
		<p>Later, she could feel the heat of the sugar-filled coffee she had swallowed spreading to the edges of her cold body. The naked mole rat was revered by her ancestors. Although they are mammals, they do not have the ability to regulate their body temperature, which allows them to operate with little energy. Naked mole rat beastmen also possess this characteristic, and even in their human forms, are able to reduce their physical consumption at the trivial cost of being cold.</p>
		<p><i>Delicious......</i>, she thought.</p>
		<p>The doughnuts, now three quarters eaten, were sweeter than any sweets she had back home.</p>
		<p>She was aware that she had already taken in enough calories to meet her needs, but she was sure she could eat at least one more.</p>
		<p><i>After all, human food is good.......</i></p>
		<p>It had been two days since they had arrived in the city. After spending the night in a lodging facility offered to residents who had lost their homes, Natalia and Shirou went out to the main street near the market.</p>
		<p>Being a large city, there were more than one or two restaurants that offered free meals. As Natalia looked around, she saw people everywhere who were just like them, eating donuts and drinking coffee to satisfy their hunger. They were blowing on cigarettes that they had procured from somewhere else to pass the time after dinner.</p>
		<p>“Hello, little crow girl.”</p>
		<p>She moved her eyes from the street to the sound of the voice and saw a familiar face. It was the black marketeer.</p>
		<p>“Ah, the Mister, too. We meet again.”</p>
		<p>The black marketeer sat down next to Natalia, greeting her as well as Shirou, who was standing against the wall of the store. He took a bite of the donut in his hand and sipped his coffee.</p>
		<p>“That….. hits the spot.” said the merchant.</p>
		<p>“Mister, you have money, why are you eating that?” ask Natalia curiously.</p>
		<p>“Shh. It’s okay, They’re giving it away for free. Everyone does this.” responded the merchant.</p>
		<p>Natalia thought quietly to herself. She really wanted to share some of the food they had with the family of goat beastmen she and Shirou had met in the past. The Merry family had since been accepted into a distant beastmen’s hideout and had parted ways. She wondered if the family was doing well. She figured that such gentle people, who grew up in a human town, may be at a loss when dealing with beastmen with no sense of decency, but at least it was better than going back to their hometown.</p>
		<p>“Kaa!” cried out Kuro, suddenly.</p>
		<p>Natalia looked across the boulevard and saw a large number of people walking towards them, spread out horizontally across both the sidewalks and roadway.</p>
		<p>“Hey, hey, there it is…..”</p>
		<p>Natalia was speechless as she listened to the black marketeer’s strained voice and looked at the people walking near the front of the procession. There were women with their hair shorn.</p>
		<p>The next few men, who may have originally been handsome, had their shirts torn here and there, and their faces were covered with blue bruises and blood.</p>
		<p>They were followed by a back row of dark-eyed people. They were armed with wooden and iron sticks and were pounding the ground nearby with their weapons to intimidate those in the front row who had fallen behind after tripping. It was a scene she had seen in many places where there had been warfare.</p>
		<p>“Traitors......” Natalia shuddered at the unearthly voice of a nearby stranger.</p>
		<p>In a low voice, she asked the black marketeer. “Is there a banishment movement going on here too?”</p>
		<p>“Banishment ......? What on earth is that? Is that they call it out there?” responded the black marketeer.</p>
		<p>He then looked coldly at the crowd that had somehow taken over the street.</p>
		<p>“They’re the ones who live on the other side of the city. During the war, the enemy’s headquarters was over there, and various buildings and infrastructure were seized. The fighting during the liberation was terrible. People couldn’t evacuate because they were too far from the forest, so many people died in the fighting. Security is still very bad.”</p>
		<p>The women walking in the front had small babies in their arms. Some of the women had large bellies. Natalia already knew what this meant. These women were having children with the enemy.</p>
		<p>The women, in contrast to the grieving men behind them, were glaring back at the crowd on the side of the road with sharp eyes. They looked like the eyes of a beast protecting its own child.</p>
		<p>“Traitor!”</p>
		<p>“Fuck you!”</p>
		<p>From every corner of the street came curses that stung Natalia’s skin.</p>
		<p>He must have read her emotions from her blood drained face. The voice of the black marketeer crawled on the ground, “No matter how small the damage was, there were people in this town who lost something. I just can’t forgive those people who were playing it cool with the enemy while we were having it so bad.”</p>
		<p>He concluded, pouring a cup of bitter coffee down his throat without looking at the sweet donuts.</p>
		<p>“They were desperate for survival, too. The women may have genuinely loved the enemy men.</p>
		<p>The children are innocent......., but such smart words won’t get us anywhere. This is a more primitive and emotional thing. If anyone can suppress this, they are a graduate of the human race.......”</p>
		<p>The expressions on the faces of the people on the side of the road watching the procession were complicated. Some people cheered and cursed, while others just watched the proceedings bitterly.</p>
		<p>The one thing they all had in common though is that no one said “Stop.” They all knew what would happen if they did. Natalia did not say anything, and of course Shirou was silent.</p>
		<p>However, there was a hint of spitefulness in his demeanor, perhaps because he felt uncomfortable with this scene in his own way.</p>
		<p>The procession passed right in front of Natalia and the others. As the black marketeer looked down, Natalia also looked down at her own toes.</p>
		<p>That’s when it happened. It was at that moment that a figure interrupted the slow-moving, muddy procession of evil.</p>
		<p>“Hey, ......, what?”</p>
		<p>When Natalia looked, she almost dropped her cup of coffee. That pretentious jacket. It was that beastman, Garte.</p>
		<p>“Hey. What’s all the fuss about, huh?”</p>
		<p>As he kept asking without hesitation, the beastman’s voice drew the attention of the people in the crowd. A member of the angry crowd answered him.</p>
		<p>“These people are traitors who have been in league with the enemy. We’re going to go to the square now, and we’re going to bring them all to justice.”</p>
		<p>Natalia saw clearly that Garte’s eyes were blinking in wonder. Then he must have thought of something. He clapped his hands and said in a very lucid voice, “Oh, so when they were strong, you were too scared to touch them, but now that they’re weak, you’re all going to take them down. That’s good. Hahaha!”</p>
		<p>There was an explosion of emotion, as Natalia wondered if there was anything worse he could have said to pour more fuel on the fire.</p>
		<p>“What the hell! Are you saying we’re cowards?” The man who had explained the situation grabbed Garte in a fit of rage.</p>
		<p>“You’re gonna get it, you bastard!”</p>
		<p>It must have been reflex. Garte’s barking tiger hair spread across his face, merging with the body hair that was rising from the chest of his open shirt, completely covering his skin tone.</p>
		<p>The man’s eyes widened at the sudden expansion of the person he had grabbed, as he was pushed by Garte, who sent him flying at least two meters horizontally. The man tumbled to the ground with his friends.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, he was only slightly injured thanks to his comrades who were now trapped underneath him, and he shouted loudly to Garte while holding his aching shoulder.</p>
		<p>“Monster!”</p>
		<p>“What the hell? What kind of monster is a tiger?” Garte’s voice was as angry as a man’s, and the whole place was in an uproar.</p>
		<p>“A beastman!”</p>
		<p>“It’s a tiger beastman!”</p>
		<p>The women who had been trapped by the crowd escaped during the commotion, and the men who tried to follow were beaten to death with wooden and iron sticks by those of the crowd who noticed.</p>
		<p>However, the hardened eyes of the crowd were mostly focused on the beastly Garte alone.</p>
		<p>It was not a march anymore.</p>
		<p>Natalia spotted a large sack of flour in a crate by a store behind her and shouted out,</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami!”</p>
		<p>It was almost at the same time that Shirou, who had instantly guessed Natalia’s intentions from the direction of her eyes, took and threw the bag of flour into the street, just as the first man who had been pushed pulled a pistol from his pants pocket.</p>
		<p>He must have ripped the bag open with his fingertips the moment he grabbed it. The flour that went flying between Garte and the crowd created a white smoke screen just a moment before the pistol shot went off.</p>
		<p>Shirou quickly rushed into it and pulled out Garte, who had turned into a powdery white tiger. Natalia, who had secured an escape route to a back alley on the side of the building, waved loudly for them to come follow her and then they quickly left the area.</p>
		<p>“Hey! What the hell was that guy doing, he shot at us out of nowhere!”</p>
		<p>Garte ranted while holding his shoulder. Fortunately, the bullet seemed to have only grazed his flesh. There was a small amount of blood and scorch marks on his fur, but the fact that he was running around screaming like an idiot showed that he was not seriously injured.</p>
		<p>“Did I say something wrong!? I’m just telling you what I saw!”</p>
		<p>Natalia laughed at him as he continued to yell at her while they were running away.</p>
		<p>“You’re right. I don’t think you said anything wrong. It’s just that you were extremely airheaded.”</p>
		<p>She wondered why she felt Garte’s out-of-place comment back there was like a breath of fresh air.</p>
		<p>“I was giving them a compliment in the first place! It’s a basic rule of hunting to target your opponent when they’re weak! I’m not sure if they’ve ever heard of this, but I’m sure you’ve heard of it!?”</p>
		<p>“............. Mr. Garte, has anyone ever told you that you are losing it by the way you talk?”</p>
		<p>They ran through the back alleys and straight out of the city. It was a mad dash by three healthy beastmen. There was no one who could catch up with them.</p>
		<p>After sending Garte off into the forest, Natalia and Shirou quietly returned to the main street.</p>
		<p>They had a hunch that something was about to go horribly wrong. They were right. Even before they could return to their original spot, their ears were greeted by the sound of many angry voices.</p>
		<p>“Don’t let the invaders get away with it! Don’t tolerate the beastmen! This time, we must protect this city with our own hands!”</p>
		<p>“Their lair is in the forest! Everyone, take your weapons!”</p>
		<p>“Drive the beastmen out of the forest! Or better yet, take their village! It’s time to punish them for the way they’ve been treating us!”</p>
		<p>The main street looked like a boiling pot of anger. The people who had been denouncing the traitors earlier had turned their anger toward a different entity, the beastmen, and it exploded, engulfing the residents who had been frustrated by their rough behavior.</p>
		<p>The situation was further aggravated by the men who seemed to be black marketeers lurking around the city. They were selling leftover weapons from the war to people. They justified the sale of the bulky firearms and cutlery as self-defense and weapons of freedom, and took the opportunity to sell them to the angry crowds. They are certainly sober and know that the beastmen are not evil enough to warrant such weapons.</p>
		<p>When Natalia spotted the black marketeer she had been chatting with earlier among the profiteers, she angrily ran up to him.</p>
		<p>“Mister, what are you doing?</p>
		<p>A cunning face turned to her and shouted.</p>
		<p>“Oh, crow girl! I’m in the middle of a big day, stay away from danger!”</p>
		<p>“That’s not what I meant! Do you even know what you’re doing?” snapped Natalia.</p>
		<p>The tone of his voice dropped unexpectedly when he heard her words, “I don’t have a choice.”</p>
		<p>His reply and the dark look in his eyes made Natalia jump.</p>
		<p>“I warned them over and over again. I taught them over and over again. I even paid, on their behalf, many times! They never listened! They said it was too much trouble, that they didn’t care about humans!”</p>
		<p>Natalia listened, stunned.</p>
		<p>“It’s over! The only thing left to do is to make him understand by force. They’re only animals, that’s what they are! The only way to discipline them is to hurt them!”</p>
		<p>A faint sense of loneliness seeped into her sly face, depriving Natalia of the words to reply.</p>
		<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
		<p>As Shirou grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her closer, she had no strength left to resist. This time it was the beastmen’s fault. The beastmen were to blame for this incident.</p>
		<p>They had not tried to understand the humans, and had allowed the relationship to become so complicated.</p>
		<p>However, the reaction of the humans was also too strong. She didn’t expect them to target the entire village. It was not enough to save one or two people as they had done in the past.</p>
		<p>An unprecedented rescue on a massive scale was needed.</p>
		<p>It didn’t take much effort to find the beastman village deep in the forest. The beastly Shirou’s nose was able to track the faint scent of blood from the fleeing Garte as accurately as if he were pulling a string.</p>
		<p>“The humans are coming with their weapons. Prepare to flee now!”</p>
		<p>The inhabitants of the village took the sudden appearance of the wolf beastman’s words with surprising candor. They must have heard the story from Garte, who had returned just before.</p>
		<p>Then all hell broke loose.</p>
		<p>“Pack your things, pack your things!”</p>
		<p>“What’s with this wardrobe? It won’t go out the door! How did I get it into the house?”</p>
		<p>“Food, how do we get food out the house ...... ah, let’s stuff our cheek pouches. Good thing I’m a chipmunk beastman!”</p>
		<p>There were voices of anger and lamentation as people were preparing cargo here and there.</p>
		<p>“Why are the humans attacking us?”</p>
		<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know. I heard they’re angry about something.”</p>
		<p>“Did I do something wrong? I just got some clothes I liked.”</p>
		<p>“I’ve only ever hit people I didn’t like.”</p>
		<p>“It’s strange.......”</p>
		<p>As she helped the beastmen pack up their things, Natalia couldn’t help but think about this exchange.</p>
		<p>No one understands the origin of this situation, after all. It was true that the anger of the town’s people was triggered from accidental circumstances, and that they were taking it out on the beastmen. However, the actions of the beastmen in this village had also placed a heavy burden on the humans. Garte’s comment was just the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
		<p><i>If I had come here earlier, could I have stopped this?</i> Natalia asked herself and shook her head without pausing to think.</p>
		<p>It was impossible. If she had tried to persuade the beastmen to change their behavior, they would not have listened at all, just like the black marketeer’s struggle. That’s what beastmen are. That’s what beastmen are all about. It was only when they were helpless that they turned their heads and said, “Huh?” It was only when they were helpless that they turned their heads and said, “What’s wrong?”</p>
		<p>They are overwhelmingly opportunistic. They are an unthinking species. Their only saving grace is that they have the grace to flee immediately when they realize they are at a disadvantage.</p>
		<p>Natalia looked around.</p>
		<p>There was not a single beastman who insisted on fighting to protect the village. It was probably a wild survival strategy born from the fact that their bodies were strong enough to survive even after they had escaped. There is a difference between them and the people who are still shouting in the main streets to protect their city.</p>
		<p>But.</p>
		<p>“Wow, I have so much stuff I can’t pack it all! Somebody help me!”</p>
		<p>“Shut up, I don’t care! We’re shorthanded too!”</p>
		<p>“Hey, man! Help me with mine first! You can do yours later, right?!”</p>
		<p>Brilliant, zero coordination.</p>
		<p>The big and strong beastmen had built their houses large enough to accommodate their post-transformation physiques, and they were taking their time to pack. The smaller beastmen, on the other hand, were quicker to pack their belongings, but were hampered by the rowdy beastmen and were unable to escape.</p>
		<p>“What are you going to do about this, Mr. Ogami?......”</p>
		<p>As Natalia watched the scene, she called out to Shirou for help, but he made it sound like it was no big deal.</p>
		<p>“The only way to quickly get away is to take the beastmen who are ready. If it comes down to it, I’ll hold off the humans.”</p>
		<p>“I’m telling you, that’s going to irritate them even more…” replied Natalia.</p>
		<p>She was just about to say something when.</p>
		<p>“Hey, hey!”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, there was a voice calling out to Natalia and Shirou. -It was Garte who was calling out to them from in front of the biggest house of all.</p>
		<p>“What is it?”</p>
		<p>As Natalia and the others rushed over to him, he spoke with a weak look on his face that he had never shown before.</p>
		<p>“My wife was so startled by this whole thing that she went into labor! You have to do something!”</p>
		<p>“What? You have a wife of your own, and you’re just wandering around town?” exclaimed Natalia.</p>
		<p>“I was waiting for her to give birth, but she didn’t, so I figured I should cause I was bored......”</p>
		<p>“You drunken cat! Get out of the way!” demanded Natalia.</p>
		<p>Natalia ran into the house, crossing in front of Garte, who quickly stepped aside. In the back bedroom, she saw a woman with a pale face grunting and groaning. Natalia was also a beastwoman. In her hometown, she had witnessed a birth. She knew at once that she was not a moment too soon. As she ran back outside, Natalia raised her voice.</p>
		<p>“You drunken cat, please go get the midwife, is she gone?!”</p>
		<p>“No, she’s probably still here, but she’s probably getting ready to run away.......”</p>
		<p>“Shut up, don’t be so auspicious now, go!” shouted Natalia.</p>
		<p>“Fuck!” exclaimed Garte.</p>
		<p>She then immediately shouted to Shirou, “Mr. Ogami. I want everyone to stop working for a moment! We’re all in disarray and we’re not doing a good job! There’s still time. I’ll take charge!”</p>
		<p>“Understood,” responded Shirou.</p>
		<p>Natalia stood before the assembled beastmen shortly after Garte had brought her a well-built midwife who was large enough to be his rival. There was frustration on everyone’s face that the work had been stopped, but it was one of the habits of the beastmen to obey the loudest creature for some reason. Natalia raised her voice as loudly as she could.</p>
		<p>“We can’t just run away in small groups. We’re all going to move out together!”</p>
		<p>The beastmen’s eyes rolled around as they immediately looked at the villagers next to them.</p>
		<p>Even though they were all living in one place, the largest unit they were used to protecting was their own family at most. A whole village working together was out of the question.</p>
		<p>However, Natalia had an idea.</p>
		<p>“If we all work together, we won’t lose anything but our homes! We can even rebuild the same village in another place!”</p>
		<p>Even though they don’t have much of a spirit of mutual aid, they understood the advantages of working in groups. Taking advantage of their simple mindset, Natalia urged them to unite.</p>
		<p>“But come on, if we do that, the humans will catch us,” said a weak voice from one of the beastmen.</p>
		<p>Another one of the beastmen also spoke up weakly, “Don’t worry. The humans won’t attack until tomorrow morning.”</p>
		<p>“They won’t come in the night?” asked another.</p>
		<p>Natalia nodded and answered the question, “Yes. They think we are like animals. Humans can’t see well at night, so they know they’ll be at a disadvantage if they venture out into the mountains at night.”</p>
		<p>“But a night is a short time, and we won’t make it until tomorrow morning,” said the anxious voice of another beastman.</p>
		<p>Natalia responded with a faint smile on her face, “No problem. I will make this village disappear by the end of the night.”</p>
		<p>The forest fires that had been visible from the top of the city tower gradually faded as the sky turned white, the smoke becoming indistinguishable from the clouds. It seemed that the beastmen had built a fire to keep watch over the night. The city folk figured it was a good thing that they hadn’t attacked unwisely.</p>
		<p>They were up against beastmen who had been nesting in the forest for centuries. Hunting in the mountains at night was a risk, and as they waited until dawn to attack, their biggest concern was that the people’s enthusiasm would wane in the meantime. This will work, they thought.</p>
		<p>“You have that look on your face, kid.” said a man As he stepped down from the tower and saw the man’s mouth hanging open in front of the armed people from a distance, he uttered a call that was impossible to hear and pulled the hood of his cloak and over his eyes, as he blended noiselessly into the crowd.</p>
		<p>“Are you all ready? Let’s go!”</p>
		<p>“Oh!”</p>
		<p>The man from earlier, who looked more like a righteous commander fanning the crowd than a leader, shouted out loudly, and the humans rose to their feet, stomping their shoes and entering the forest with authority. Leading the way was a hunter who knew the mountains well. He was followed by a group of men carrying what appeared to be military-style rifles. Carrying them on their shoulders, they appeared to be veterans who had returned from the battlefield. The agitator was there as well, but his hands were a little unsteady with his gun, as if he had not participated in the war despite his efforts to incite the people.</p>
		<p>The largest number of people at the end of the line were the young people of the city. They were only allowed to carry small knives or pistols, and their shoulders, which had been angry before we entered the forest, were slowly drooping as the darkness of the trees grew thicker.</p>
		<p>It seemed that half of them were dropping out of the group on their own without doing anything.</p>
		<p>While hiding in the midst of these young men, Shirou watched the movements of the hunter leading the way. At first, the hunter’s feet had been moving deeper and deeper without hesitation, but at a certain point, he started to stop more often. The air that drifted through the trees was different. This is a space where humans rarely enter, where the primeval forest has its own rules. According to the story, it was the beastmen who guided them to the village when they entered the forest after escaping the war. They figured they must have met around here.</p>
		<p>“What are you looking for?”</p>
		<p>Shirou heard the man behind him ask the hunter a question.</p>
		<p>“It’s an eye symbol. It’s right here.”</p>
		<p>Shirou saw a thin string tied to a branch of a tall tree that was darkening the forest sky. It was not something that the beastman had prepared, so the hunter must have attached it on his own.</p>
		<p>The words of the beastman girl with the intelligent look in her eyes unknowingly came back to his mind, Humans don’t know everything about the forest, we don’t know everything about the forest, we just know the points that are easy to remember and connect them together.</p>
		<p>You’re right, Natalia, Shirou thought.</p>
		<p>Shirou chuckled behind his hood as he kept pace with the group. That means that this group is already under her control.</p>
		<p>They walked a long way, although they took a few breaks along the way, the journey was much steeper than they had imagined, and the fatigue on the faces of the humans was growing.</p>
		<p>Two-thirds of the group of young people still remained, but this was not because they had guts, but because they were desperate not to go home alone.</p>
		<p>“Hey, are you sure we’re going the right way?” The ring-leader of the group, his forehead covered with sweat, asked the hunter.</p>
		<p>“Yeah. There are footprints of adults and children here and there, and some of the branches of the shorter trees are broken. This is evidence that many people have passed through here recently. We’re getting closer to the fire that we saw last night. Stay alert.”</p>
		<p>The leader’s arm tightened around his rifle, indicating that a battle was imminent. More walking. As the green of the forest grew darker, the moisture in the air increased. Suddenly, the hunter called a halt to his followers.</p>
		<p>“Look. These footprints.”</p>
		<p>On the softened soil were the footprints of a large animal.</p>
		<p>“They look like bears, but they’re...... bipedal.”</p>
		<p>“A beastman.......!”</p>
		<p>The footprints led deeper into the forest.</p>
		<p>When the group swallowed their saliva and looked ahead, they immediately saw that there was a light shining deep into the forest. It meant that there was an open space.</p>
		<p>“It’s too quiet, ....... they could be lurking around. Watch out for noises.”</p>
		<p>The men became more cautious and moved forward with their guns ready to fire at any moment. The light-filled square was only ten meters away, five meters .......three meters</p>
		<p>......arrival.</p>
		<p>“What the hell is this......!?”</p>
		<p>The men were left standing in a circle. There were no houses, no beastmen, nothing but a small space with a few traces of simple fires.</p>
		<p>“It’s gone. The village is gone, they’re gone......”</p>
		<p>The hunter muttered in dismay.</p>
		<p>They hear the crunching sound of twigs being stepped on and turn their guns around, only to see the thick tail of a fox fleeing into the bushes.</p>
		<p>Were they being bewitched? ...... The men’s puzzled faces showed that they didn’t even have the energy to be angry about anything anymore. The forest is steep and deep, and the darkness is so dim that even just walking in it would kill you. The tension was followed by a sense of release from their feeling that they were being spurred on. They wondered what they were really doing, their eyes filled with gratitude for being alive, as they listened to the chirping of the birds around them.</p>
		<p>The plan was a great success.</p>
		<p>After watching from a short distance away, Shirou snatched the last of the markers the hunter had relied on from a branch and retreated into the darkness of the forest. He didn’t know how far they’ll get back without the markers, but he didn’t care if they got into trouble, at least it will buy the beastmen some time. It took the group more than half a day to get this location. The beastmen would have finished packing and left by the time they had figured out what happened. At least for the plan Natalia had scraped together from scratch, it was more than enough time.</p>
		<p>It was the rabbit beastman right next to her who told her that someone was coming from behind, running through the forest at a ridiculous speed. Natalia, who immediately recognized the creature from her words and understood that it couldn’t be human, waved at the gray beastman she saw in the gap between the trees.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami!”</p>
		<p>It was, after all, Shirou, who had hidden himself among the humans in case of an emergency.</p>
		<p>“Listen up, everyone. The mission was a success. The humans are in the middle of nowhere, and are no longer a threat.”</p>
		<p>“Ooooh!” The beastmen, who were walking in a line, cheered.</p>
		<p>“There’s no way they can catch up to us at this point. Get some rest.”</p>
		<p>The beastmen let go of their carts and backpacks and quickly surrounded Natalia, the person who had done the most for them.</p>
		<p>“Thank you. We couldn’t have done it without you!”</p>
		<p>I didn’t think we’d actually be able to move the whole village. It’s amazing!</p>
		<p>Natalia blushed at the praise.</p>
		<p>Natalia was a small, weak beastman. Even in her hometown, she had been ridiculed by the larger beasts – which were most of the inhabitants of her village – and had never received any praise. It was the first time she had been recognized like this.</p>
		<p>“It wasn’t just me….”</p>
		<p>The voice that came out of her desire for more of this applause was surprisingly humble and righteous, even to herself.</p>
		<p>“It’s a result of the combined efforts of all the people who helped Miss Reed and those who carried out the big loads in the meantime!”</p>
		<p>“That’s right. You guys are capable of amazing things, aren’t you? I’m amazed!”</p>
		<p>Garte, holding his wife with a baby on her chest in a chair strapped to his back, stroked the heads of the small beastmen in turn. The rabbits, mice, and other beasts were good at running away. On the other hand, there were foxes and weasels that were good at following traces. In the village, there were many large carnivorous beastmen, and the small animal beastmen lived in the corners. Naturally, they were treated poorly and always drew the short end of the stick.</p>
		<p>This time, however, they were able to fool even the eyes of the hunters, who were used to hiking in the mountains, thanks to their advice on how to look at things from both sides, the ones running away and the ones chasing. The subtlety of their work, which could never be duplicated by big, rough beasts, gradually widened the margin of error and lured even the most experienced hunters to the wrong place.</p>
		<p>“Oh no. But you guys are the reason I didn’t give up on the furniture.....”</p>
		<p>“It’s hard to make everything from scratch again, so this is a big help.......”</p>
		<p>This time, the large beasts, who were the best at fighting, focused on carrying the luggage. In Natalia’s plan, which did not involve any bloodshed, their monstrous strength was used peacefully.</p>
		<p>“That’s good to know. Hahahaha!”</p>
		<p>Garte and the others laughed as the rabbit beastmen returned the compliment of their contribution. Natalia let out a sigh of admiration. What had happened this time had been a surprise to her as well.</p>
		<p>Beastmen working together to accomplish a single thing. This was actually a rare occurrence and was actually not an easy thing to do.</p>
		<p>It was definitely her who was in charge, but she didn’t expect it to go so well. She never thought that these selfish, self-centered, and uncooperative beastmen could cooperate so well and to such an extent. It was as if they’re smart people.</p>
		<p>Beastmen are not helpless beings, she thought. They just have a fundamentally uncivilized way of thinking. It’s just that they are not used to working together.</p>
		<p>“Ogami,” suddenly, a gentle voice came from the chair behind Garte’s back. It was Garte’s wife, Fouko. She was draping her husband’s jacket over her body and the baby as a blanket.</p>
		<p>“Thank you so much for what you did. If it hadn’t been for you two, I wouldn’t have been able to give birth to this baby safely. I’m really grateful.”</p>
		<p>She looked exhausted after giving birth, but she was too beautiful to be a drunken cat. “I didn’t do anything,” Shirou shook his head and gave Natalia a tap on the shoulder from behind.</p>
		<p>“It’s all thanks to her.”</p>
		<p>“Hey, hey, Mr. Ogami…”</p>
		<p>“Thank you, Natalia.” said Fouko softly.</p>
		<p>Natalia was embarrassed by Fouko’s gentle gaze, so she lowered her eyes and said, “N-No problem......”</p>
		<p>“Natalia, It’s a girl. Can I name her Natalie?”</p>
		<p>“O-oh, you want to name her after me......?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, I do, because I want her to be smart and strong like you.” responded Fouko</p>
		<p>“Of course you can, it’s okay......”</p>
		<p>Her fluster reached an irresistible level and Natalia ruffled the locks of her hair with both hands. A startled Kuro flapped his wings and paced right and left on her head.</p>
		<p>“She really is a great partner, wolf. I’m sure even the legendary Silver Wolf would approve of this one,” Garte laughed gaily as he spoke with Shirou.</p>
		<p>There was no way he knew who Shirou was. It was just a joke, a reference to a legend.</p>
		<p>However, Natalia couldn’t help but look at Shirou. His brows relaxed slightly and a smile appeared on his face.</p>
		<p>“Yeah. I’m sure he would say he’s glad you’re here. Thanks, ...... Natalia.”</p>
		<p>Natalia’s heart leapt in her chest as she saw the gentle smile on his face, which was completely different from when he looked at humans. He is the Silver Wolf. He is a legendary savior who has supported the beastmen for a thousand years.</p>
		<p>Such a great man thanked her. No, even without that title, Natalia was so happy that this hard man had honestly acknowledged her that she was completely lost for words to reply.</p>
		<p>Her thoughts raced, I want to be praised by him more. I want to be recognized by him more. I can help the beastmen that he can’t. I can make up for what he lacks.</p>
		<p>I can be his partner.</p>
		<p>Maybe this is what I’ve been looking for...</p>
		<p>As she chained her thoughts together, her heart thumping even more, Natalia just continued to stare at the gray wolf, standing alone and quiet amidst the beastmen’s laughter.</p>
