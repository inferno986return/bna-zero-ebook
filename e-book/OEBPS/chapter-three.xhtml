	<h1 class="heading">Chapter 3 – Stray Gangster</h1>

	<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>he deck of the ship suddenly became noisy with the appearance of calling seabirds. A blackbird, perhaps in a rivalry with the white silhouettes overhead, spread its wings and chirped loudly, but this one bird was no match for the cheers of the people gathered on deck.</p>
		<p>“I see the city!”</p>
		<p>“America! It’s New York!”</p>
		<p>As the skyscrapers glistened in the sunlight, Natalia’s feet froze in place, even though she had to get back to the cargo hold. The scene made her realize that everything she had seen so far was just old towns and cities. If her sense of distance was correct, she figured the silvery square buildings towering toward the heavens were so huge that one of them could easily house all the inhabitants of a beastman village by itself. They seemed to be stacked on top of each other, standing in a heap on the land. She had never seen nor heard of anything like this.</p>
		<p>Natalia’s words came out with a sigh, "This is...... America.......”</p>
		<p>While aiding beastmen who had been forced to flee their homes, they all had jumped on an immigrant ship to escape. It was less than one week later. If they had been traveling on foot, she would have been able to visually follow the changes in the landscape, but what awaited them across the sea was a different and futuristic world. Humans had already advanced to a point that beastmen cannot understand.</p>
		<p>With a mixture of excitement and awe in her heart, Natalia took one last look at the skyscraper and quickly left.</p>
		<p>“Alright all of you beastmen. Let’s get out of here.”</p>
		<p>At Shirou’s signal, the beastmen emerged from the darkness of the cargo hold, and using their natural agility and keen senses, ducked under the scrutiny of the ship’s crew and jumped into the sea one after another. This was opposed to the cheers of the passengers who proudly descended the ramps to the docks.</p>
		<p>“Oh my God, it’s cold.”</p>
		<p>“Shhhh. Be quiet. We're swimming as far as we can around to the side of the harbor.”</p>
		<p>The father and son of the capybara beastmen swam along, arguing with each other. There were three families for a total of ten people. None of the group, including Natalia, Shirou, and Kuro, had official tickets to be aboard the ship. They were all complete stowaways.</p>
		<p>As soon as Shirou and Natalia realized that they were on an immigrant ship, they considered returning to land, but the three families, who had been forced to flee their homes twice in a short period of time, wanted to find a new place to live rather than return to their homeland, which had been ravaged both psychologically and materially by the war.</p>
		<p>Shirou was not the kind of man to just abandon them. In the end, Natalia also decided to join them all in going to America.</p>
		<p>Natalia was the first to make it to the corner of the dock and reach for the concrete platform.</p>
		<p>The platform was not built for unloading cargo, and was so high that it was difficult for her to reach. She simply felt ashamed of her small body. If she had been in her beast form, she could have been a little more athletic, but she was still in human form.</p>
		<p>“Gotcha….”</p>
		<p>Her hand, which was stretched out as far as it could go, was suddenly grabbed from above.</p>
		<p>“What!?” exclaimed Natalia.</p>
		<p>A human face peeked out from the platform and said, “Hold on, I’m going to lift you up.”</p>
		<p>He was a well-tanned man with long frayed black hair. He was wearing what looked like work clothes.</p>
		<p>“When you get up here, stay here and don’t move,” he sternly commanded.</p>
		<p>The man then pulled the other beastmen up one by one. Natalia grew impatient. The man seemed to be some kind of port official. She was sure that he would report all of them to his peers for being stowaways. She quickly looked around, but there was no one else in sight besides the man. If they wanted to escape, they could have, but the boat ride and swimming had left the beastman families exhausted.</p>
		<p>Natalia figured that the only way to get out of this place was to do something about him. It would most likely come down to Shirou doing something. However, if this blew up into a larger problem as soon as they had just arrived, the large group of them would be completely stuck and in trouble in a strange foreign land. Natalia felt helpless.</p>
		<p>“Are you the last?” asked the man.</p>
		<p>“Yes.” responded Shirou.</p>
		<p>After watching Shirou crawl up on his own, the man looked around at Natalia and the others who were sitting down and said, “My people, welcome!”</p>
		<p>“What?..” Natalia was surprised and stared at the man’s face as he shouted his welcome.</p>

		<p>“You’re a beastman?”</p>
		<p>The black-haired man grinned and nodded as Shirou confirmed what he had known all along.</p>
		<p>“I’m Vincent. I’m a black panther beastman.”</p>
		<p>It was hard to tell from the smell of the tide and the sea, but Vincent definitely smelled like a beastman.</p>
		<p>“It’s not a good idea to let ourselves be seen. All of you come over here.”</p>
		<p>They did as Vincent asked and moved to a small warehouse. There was a group of beastmen there who seemed to be his friends.</p>
		<p>“Who? Vincent, who are these people?” One of them asked.</p>
		<p>“They're beastmen. They were on the immigrant ship we saw earlier.”</p>
		<p>The men looked at each other for a moment and then laughed.</p>
		<p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, seriously? You're stowaways! You guys went all in!”</p>
		<p>“That’s quite a lot, about ten people? How did you do it with that many people?”</p>
		<p>“Welcome to America, land of the free!”</p>
		<p>They greeted them so affectionately that Natalia and the others could only stare blankly.</p>
		<p>Their groove was very different from any beastman she had ever seen.</p>
		<p>“Fabio?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir!” The youngest boy in the group, probably in his early teens, stretched out his back when Vincent called him.</p>
		<p>“Go get some apple pie from the store. Get enough for everyone. These guys are pretty hungry.”</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir!” After answering cheerfully, Fabio ran out of the warehouse.</p>
		<p>When they heard the word “apple pie,” a hint of anticipation appeared on the faces of the bewildered beastmen. As Vincent had guessed, they were all starving.</p>

		<p>Maybe they’re good people… thought Natalia until Shirou’s voice sharply interrupted the relaxed atmosphere.</p>
		<p>“What are you doing in a human port? Do you work here?”</p>
		<p>Was it my imagination, or did the men’s eyes seem to sharpen like knives for a moment?</p>
		<p>Natalia pondered.</p>
		<p>Vincent responded proudly, “Yeah, I work here at the port. My main job is security.”</p>
		<p>He sat down on a nearby crate and held out his arms lightly in a gesture as if to indicate the entire harbor.</p>
		<p>“Did you know that in the war, which apparently isn’t completely over yet, New York was beaten to a pulp by an enemy submarine called a U-boat?”</p>
		<p>“No.” responded Shirou.</p>
		<p>When Shirou simply shook his head, Vincent only smiled thinly as if to say, “Right?” and continued to talk without sounding so boisterous about events.</p>
		<p>“Unlike Europe, this country never became a battlefield, so we were a bit careless. However, the submarines didn’t mind crossing the sea, and in addition, more people than expected were coming to this country to escape the war, which made everyone over here nervous.</p>
		<p>There was no telling what kind of dangerous people might be mixed in with them. That’s where we come in, we can use our good sense of smell.”</p>
		<p>“Wait a minute!” Natalia could not resist interrupting.</p>
		<p>“What is it, crow girl?” asked Vincent.</p>
		<p>“This country, do they recognize beastmen?”</p>
		<p>In human society, beastmen are taboo. Although their existence is acknowledged to a limited extent in one town, region, or another, beastmen do not have an official position in any human society. Although they are human beings, they are treated similarly to stray cats or dogs that have taken up residence without permission.</p>
		<p>However, does this country, the United States, a much newer country than those of Europe, officially recognize beastmen? Natalia pondered.</p>
		<p>“Oh, uh. I don’t know. I’m not sure if it’s proper recognition, but......”</p>
		<p>Vincent’s answer was as vague as his expression. Nevertheless, the fact that the characteristics of beastmen were understood here and that he was entrusted with the job remained unchanged. A thin ray of light shone into Natalia’s heart.</p>

		<p>“Here you go, sir!” A cheerful voice came running from the edge of the warehouse. It was</p>
		<p>Fabio, carrying a paper bag in each hand.</p>
		<p>“We made this apple pie in our store. It has a reputation for being delicious, so make sure you taste it!”</p>
		<p>He handed out a slice of pie to each of the beastmen who were all looking like a bunch of wet rats.</p>
		<p>Natalia also received a slice. It was still warm, and the aroma of apples and sugar tickled the back of her nose as the steam rose. She knew even before she ate it that this was going to be an excellent meal.</p>
		<p>“The port security guards make this stuff too?” Shirou asked.</p>
		<p>“Well, we have a wide range of talents.”</p>
		<p>Vincent’s eyes flickered for a moment, and like Natalia, Shirou didn’t miss it. Without touching his apple pie, Shirou lightly swept his fingertips, pointing over towards the edge of the warehouse, and walked off in that direction. He wanted to have a private chat. Vincent chuckled faintly and followed him with a shrug of his shoulders. Natalia, along with Kuro, followed them as well without a second thought.</p>
		<p>“You've got some serious eyes, you.” Vincent said suddenly, as soon as they reached the remote location.</p>
		<p>“I’m not talking about your vision. This port is often frequented by deserters who fled from the battlefield, and they have these dry eyes that look like they've seen hell, but yours,...... are more than that. It’s like you've got hell itself inside you. What and how much do you have to see to become a creature with eyes like that?”</p>
		<p>“I don’t want to talk about it. Who are you?”</p>
		<p>He chuckled again at Shirou’s unconvincing response, "It’s counterproductive to keep secrets from a man like you, so I’ll tell you right off the bat that we're what’s commonly known as a gang.”</p>
		<p>“A gang......?” Natalia asked back.</p>
		<p>“People think we're a criminal gang that deals in bootlegging, secret gambling, prostitution, loansharking, usury, etc., but we're actually a bunch of scoundrels who do some illegal things from time to time.” responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>“So everything you just said was a lie......?”</p>

		<p>“No. No, it’s all true. The Port of New York was originally controlled by gangs, and the federal government couldn’t get their hands on it. However, it’s also true that suspicious foreigners like spies come and go from here. That’s why we've been asked by local families to take on the job of maintaining security.”</p>
		<p>“The bad guys keep the peace?” Shirou said in disgust.</p>
		<p>“What’s wrong with that? Even scoundrels need a quiet bed to sleep in.” Vincent smiled back cynically, not even pretending to be offended.</p>
		<p>“What are you going to do with us?” asked Shirou.</p>
		<p>“Let me ask you this, do you have any idea where you're going?”</p>
		<p>Hey! Natalia glanced at the beastmen who were eating the apple pie with relish. She realized that she hadn’t even taken a bite of her delicious looking pie, but she held it for now and attempted to answer the question.</p>
		<p>“I don’t think......”</p>
		<p>“We can provide you with a safe place to sleep," Vincent said shortly, cutting her off.</p>
		<p>“We're in charge of guarding this port and the edge of the city. We can house everyone there.”</p>
		<p>“Are you sure?” When she looked at him expectantly, Vincent turned his palm to her and said,</p>
		<p>“However," rebuffing Natalia’s voice.</p>
		<p>“This is not a charity project either. They will be paid rent, and as long as they live here, they will work. If they're strong, they can unload the cargo at the port. If they're not strong, they can work somewhere else. Fortunately, in this town, the restaurants get ridiculously busy at mealtime, so that’s where weaker ones will be for the time being. If that doesn’t work, I’ll see if</p>
		<p>I can find them another job”</p>
		<p>He rubbed his chin and looked at the beastmen families as if he were examining them.</p>
		<p>“Yes,....... The girl over there is quite a good judge of character. I think she’d make a good waitress.”</p>
		<p>“............You really think she should be a waitress?” stared Natalia.</p>
		<p>Vincent then broke her tense mood and poked the black beak of Kuro on her head mischievously.</p>

		<p>“What’s the matter, little crow? Are you imagining the kid working in a dirty restaurant?”</p>
		<p>“Hey, down here! I asked the question!”</p>
		<p>When Kuro growled at him, Vincent grinned and withdrew his hand.</p>
		<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have any fancy restaurants.” responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>“Mmm.......”</p>
		<p>Natalia grunted. If what he was saying was true, this opportunity would not only be a good thing, it would be a blessing in disguise for the beastmen families. After all, they had come to this country almost by force. This would replace the fear of the unknown with a feeling of hope. They might be able to make it in this country, she thought.</p>
		<p>As Natalia thought this, a cold voice passed over her head, “You make it sound too good to be true.”</p>
		<p>It was Shirou, the wrinkles between his eyebrows were as bold as ever. He’s always had a strong sense of caution, but it’s even more apparent when he’s guarding beastmen.</p>
		<p>“It’s not going to work.”</p>
		<p>However, Vincent’s demeanor did not falter either. He added to his words to show he had nothing to hide, “The apartments are too small to house all of them together. They won’t have the same freedom as when they were living alone with other beastmen. The wages are less than they are for humans, but they will still have to pay a portion of it to us. This is fixed and non-negotiable.”</p>
		<p>Shirou was about to say something, but Vincent held up his index finger to stop him.</p>
		<p>“However, if they use their beastman power to their advantage, they can do the physical labor of three humans. I’ll teach them how to be in their beast forms without being seen, so they can have fun and live an easy life in the city. Not a bad deal for the beastmen, right? If they can find a better paying job, then they can go there. We're not going to stop them.”</p>
		<p>“You're awfully good at taking care of people. Why?” asked Natalia, more out of pure curiosity than suspicion.</p>
		<p>Most beastmen would really only try to protect their families, at most. Beastmen who help strangers, like Shirou, are extremely rare. Vincent’s motives seemed to have a hint of trying to protect the lives of the beastmen. Natalia could see that he had his merits. For a self-proclaimed villain, he seemed to be relaxed. He gave a wry smile and looked at the beastman families and the gang members who were talking to them.</p>

		<p>“The beastmen can get by on their own in the woods and meadows, right? It doesn’t work like that here. In a human city, we have to rely on each other to survive. We can help each other, use each other, or whatever you want to call it. Anyway, we beastmen can’t survive unless we work together. That’s why.”</p>
		<p>“Wow ......!” Natalia was honestly impressed. This beastman, Vincent, was different from any other beastman she had ever met. He understood the rules of human society and was able to fit himself into them. Was he special, or was it the climate of this country that made him so?</p>
		<p>Natalia felt that this ideal would be a great help for the future of the beastmen as a whole, and she tried to ask Vincent more questions, before suddenly.</p>
		<p>“Vincent!”</p>
		<p>A voice called out from the doorway of the warehouse, causing everyone in the room to turn around at once.</p>
		<p>“Jackson!?”</p>
		<p>An intelligent looking man with blond hair pulled back in an all-black bun appeared. He was young, probably the same age as Vincent and the others, however...</p>
		<p>“Hey......!”</p>
		<p>Shirou grabbed Vincent by the shoulder as soon as he realized who he was. Natalia was also surprised to hear the hard sound of Shirou’s accusing voice.</p>
		<p>“This guy is a human.”</p>
		<p>“Yeah?” Vincent said, nodding as if it were nothing.</p>
		<p>“Jackson’s family and ours are allies.”</p>
		<p>When Shirou heard this, the deepest wrinkle between his eyes appeared.</p>
		<p>“An alliance? You are in league with the humans?”</p>
		<p>“This is a human city, remember? What’s wrong with teaming up with humans?”</p>
		<p>Vincent tilted his head in a slightly mocking manner. Natalia could only stare blankly as the two men exchanged sharp gazes of starkly different intensity just above her head. They should not be arguing. She knew that the two of them needed to talk more, but she couldn’t find the words to stop the both of them, or rather, Shirou.</p>
		<p>Moments later, Jackson’s tense voice interrupted the stand-off.</p>

		<p>“Vincent, is this going to take long?”</p>
		<p>“No, there’s no problem. Is it time for that job?” asked Vincent.</p>
		<p>“Yes, it is. I need your help,” responded Jackson.</p>
		<p>“Alright. I’ll send out the instructions to my people and be right there.”</p>
		<p>After a quick exchange of words, Vincent walked over to his companions and told them what was going on, despite Shirou’s stern look. His friends nodded and got the beastman families up and moving. As Natalia watched the beastmen bowing their heads and thanking him for his help, Shirou’s grave voice reached her ears as he spoke againto Vincent, "I need to see if I can trust you. This is non-negotiable.”</p>
		<p>Outside the window, the scenery of the city flowed by, regardless to any movement of her own body. Unlike a wagon or a ship, the vehicle was driven by means that were completely incomprehensible to her, but she had always wondered about them.</p>
		<p>“I've never been in a car before! ”Natalia said excitedly to no one in particular, sticking to the window.</p>
		<p>“Oh that’s interesting. What do you think?” Vincent asked, catching her voice.</p>
		<p>“I feel like I’m in a house, it’s so strange!” responded Natalia.</p>
		<p>Vincent shook his head and laughed, as did Jackson.</p>
		<p>If this little car is like a house, then Cadillacs and Rolls Royces are castles.” responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>“But not as fast as I had hoped.”</p>
		<p>“Well, that’s a very beastman thing to say,” Jackson said and smiled as he gripped the steering wheel and glanced at Natalia in the backseat through the rearview mirror. "So, Vincent. Who are these two?</p>
		<p>“They are saints from Europe who have been protecting the beastmen who came over. They want to check us out and see if we are trustworthy.”</p>
		<p>Vincent, in the passenger seat, turned his head to the side and looked alternately at Shirou, who had his arms folded across his chest, and Natalia, who had not moved from the window.</p>
		<p>“You can tell the crow girl anything so long as it’s appropriate for kids under the age of 18. You can tell the man anything you want, so long as it’s not a lie.”</p>
		<p>“Is that right?” responded Jackson to Vincent.</p>

		<p>“Yes. If you try to trick or deceive him, he will smell you out. He’s a wolf, and a very nosy one at that.”</p>
		<p>“I didn’t tell you what my animal nature was.” Shirou finally spoke.</p>
		<p>“I know you didn’t. I don’t work as a security guard at the port for nothing. You have the smell of an old wolf on you.”</p>
		<p>The car carrying the four of them drove nimbly along the main street of the port district. The city was overflowing with people and goods, and Natalia was almost giddy at the complexity of the scene as they passed. It was as if she was walking through the guts of a giant creature.</p>
		<p>“We're here.”</p>
		<p>Jackson stopped the car at what appeared to be a restaurant. The sign hanging in front of the entrance read, "Preparing", but Vincent didn’t care and pushed open the door.</p>
		<p>“Hey, is the old man around?”</p>
		<p>He said in a stifled and powerful voice, a change from his calm demeanor of before. A middle-aged man who appeared to be the owner of the store immediately came out from the back.</p>
		<p>“Well, well, well, Mr. Vincent and Mr. Jackson.......”</p>
		<p>“The usual. Do you understand?” When Vincent says this, the owner turns his head as if he is being accused of something and replies weakly, “Yes......,” before heading to the back of the store. When he reappeared, he had a small paper bag in his hand.</p>
		<p>“It’s for this month.”</p>
		<p>Vincent took the slightly thick paper bag and immediately handed it to Jackson. Jackson looked at the contents and mumbled, "It’s not enough.”</p>
		<p>“W-what do you mean?”</p>
		<p>Vincent growled, and the owner shrank back like a turtle. “Our waitress quit this month and the restaurant is not doing well....... I can’t afford to pay the bouncer’s fee any more.”</p>
		<p>Bouncer’s fee, it’s one of the things that Vincent confided in Natalia and Shirou earlier, that the gang manages. In other words, they're here to collect it. However, the relationship is not that of employer and employee, but is more based on threats.</p>

		<p>“That’s for our services. We just kicked out an annoying customer who got drunk and got out of control for you the other day, didn’t we?!”</p>
		<p>In order to calm Vincent’s anger, Jackson immediately added a soothing voice, “That’s what you did last month and the month before that, Mr. Grayson. If you keep trying to get away with that kind of excuse, we'll start wondering if we're making a mistake. You might be underestimating us.......”</p>
		<p>“No, that’s not true.......”</p>
		<p>“Then I’ll have you make up this shortfall properly. You know what you have to do, don’t you?”</p>
		<p>“Y-Yes, of course.”</p>
		<p>Jackson looked at Vincent as if to ask, "Is that okay?”</p>
		<p>“Damn, I guess.” Responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>He scratched his head and suddenly relaxed. The two of them looked somewhat relieved, which made their interaction seem somewhat theatrical to Natalia.</p>
		<p>I see. ......, thought Natalia.</p>
		<p>The two of them seemed to be playing good-cop bad-cop. Vincent is the one who unilaterally crushes the other party’s arguments, and Jackson is the one who makes his demands when the other party is frightened. Aside from Jackson, who was human, Vincent was a beastman.</p>
		<p>Natalia couldn’t help but be amazed that he was capable of such social dexterity.</p>
		<p>But still,...... She continued to think.</p>
		<p>What were they going to make the shopkeeper do? Even if the exchange was theatrical, it didn’t mean that their act was fake. Their tone of voice was filled with a sharpness that let her and Shirou know that they were indeed villains. Natalia could feel Shirou’s gaze sharpening next to her. What were the demands of the gang? The two of them had to find out if they were really trustworthy or not.</p>
		<p>“The usual place is the brown apartment on the corner of Sixth Avenue, fourth floor.”</p>
		<p>What’s at that place? Thought Natalia.</p>
		<p>“Eggs Benedict, French fries, and fried chicken for eight, right? I've just finished making them and they'll be delivered soon!” The owner’s voice rang in Natalia’s ears as she focused her nerves.</p>
		<p>What? Thought Natalia bewildered.</p>

		<p>“Hey, wait a minute. How is it already done?” Quipped Vincent.</p>
		<p>“It’s a wonder, Mr. Vincent!” Responded Jackson.</p>
		<p>“Hey, old man! You’re trying to play us! Pay up with money, c’mon!”</p>
		<p>It was going to be just an order….? Thought Natalia in realization.</p>
		<p>After the owner had fled to the back of the store at Vincent’s angry voice, Natalia finally understood what was going on. When she looked to the side, she saw that Shirou had also bent his eyebrows in a strange way and was somewhat caught off guard.</p>
		<p>They left the store and went back to the parking lot as a group.</p>
		<p>“Now that’s one of our jobs, collecting the bouncer’s fee. The port attracts a lot of roughnecks.</p>
		<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s war or not, there’s always a fight going on. Some of the businesses we protect try to cheat us by giving us things in kind like that instead of money,...... but we also use that restaurant a lot, so we don’t want it to go under.”</p>
		<p>Vincent complained as they got into the car.</p>
		<p>But wouldn’t they be worse off with a sudden request of food for a large number of people?</p>
		<p>They have to have some idea of what people are going to buy, don’t they?”</p>
		<p>Natalia replied to his curious question without hesitation.</p>
		<p>“I’m sure they probably stock up more in advance in anticipation of that. By ordering in bulk, they get a discount on the purchase price, don’t they?</p>
		<p>Vincent turned around with a surprised look on his face.</p>
		<p>“You’re just now realizing that?” Jackson chuckled as he grabbed the wheel.</p>
		<p>“That bastard.......” Vincent’s mouth dropped into a grimace.</p>
		<p>“It’s only a small amount of change anyway. As long as you think you've done a good job in your gut, you should tolerate his antics. If Mr. Grayson gets carried away, then I’ll have to give him a good lesson.” His partner in the driver seat lightly admonished him, and the car started up again.</p>
		<p>Natalia was beginning to think that these two men were very funny. Even though they prided themselves on being scoundrels, there was something about them that did not hide their good-naturedness. Jackson, for his part, never showed any irreverence or arrogance toward the beastmen. He treated them as equals, or as if there were no difference in race at all.</p>

		<p>It was a completely new, yet somehow dazzling relationship. If it were to be them, they might be able to take care of the beastman families. Shirou glanced at them, but he kept his arms crossed and a frown on his face. As soon as they started moving again, Jackson suddenly stopped the car.</p>
		<p>“Vincent, look at that.”</p>
		<p>Natalia also looked in the direction he was pointing. It was another restaurant. She could see a large customer yelling something at the waitress in the glass-walled building.</p>
		<p>“I haven’t seen him before. Shall we go?”</p>
		<p>“Yeah.”</p>
		<p>They got out of the car and Natalia and Shirou followed.</p>
		<p>“I told you, there was hair in the soup I ordered!”</p>
		<p>As soon as they opened the door, a voice blasted out of the restaurant, staggering Natalia and Kuro above her.</p>
		<p>“That’s impossible! Look, it’s red hair. We all have black hair. That’s your hair!”</p>
		<p>The second wave belonged to the female waitress. The volume of her voice was more intense than the first. It’s pressure almost pushed Natalia back out the door. When Natalia looked inside and saw a small fat back with an apron wrapped around it.</p>
		<p>“What the hell is wrong with you, old lady? I’m a customer! Even if this is my hair, I don’t like the way you've treated me! Call the manager!”</p>
		<p>“Shut up, eat the rest of your food, pay up and get out of here, you idiot!”</p>
		<p>“I’m not leaving! You're making me sick. Pay me my refund!”</p>
		<p>“Sir.” Vincent’s voice interrupted the exchange of foul language with a single supple feline gesture.</p>
		<p>“Could you please be quiet? We all want our lunch hour to be pleasant and peaceful.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, Vincent! Jackson, too! Nice timing!” The waitress lady cheered brightly, as if she had forgotten how angry she was not a second beforehand.</p>
		<p>“This customer has made a hell of an accusation.”</p>
		<p>“I can tell. We could hear your loud voices outside.”</p>

		<p>Vincent turned to face the man. He must have been nearly two meters tall. He was not tanned like a longshoreman, but his thick arms, which could have been the torso of a child, were peeking out from the sleeves of his turned-up shirt. Vincent was big enough to be an adult, but compared to him, he looked two sizes too small.</p>
		<p>“What the hell is wrong with you? If you have nothing to do with this, stay out of it.”</p>
		<p>The man’s voice sounded like he was swinging a machete, but Vincent didn’t flinch, and he even smiled as he asked, “I haven’t seen you around. Did you just get here recently?”</p>
		<p>“So what if I did? I’m gonna have a field day in this town.”</p>
		<p>“I see. That’s what I thought. If you want to live here like us, it’s time to learn.”</p>
		<p>Right after he said that, Vincent turned into a black shadow and disappeared in front of the man.</p>
		<p>“What?!”</p>
		<p>As beastmen, the only people who could follow it with their eyes were Natalia and Shirou.</p>
		<p>Vincent winded his way through the aisle - the small gap between the seating area and the counter - and came up behind the man, twisting his arm in an instant. Natalia saw it. She saw the black animal hair slowly receding from the collar of Vincent’s shirt.</p>
		<p>She gasped as she realized what it meant, He turned into his beast form in an instant, and then immediately turned back into his human form......!</p>
		<p>Natalia didn’t know of any beastmen who could go through a transformation and back in such a short time.</p>
		<p>“A-Aaahh…!?”</p>
		<p>The man’s arm was twisted and he fell to his knees in agony. Vincent was holding the arm of a man twice his size with a cool expression across his face. Since he was no longer in his beast form, his arm strength was probably the same as a human. Despite this, the man was still unable to resist due to the precise twisting of his joints. Natalia could not help but be surprised by this. Beastman fights are inherently simpler and more ferocious. They use simple and dumb methods such as punching, kicking, and stomping. However, Vincent’s method was much smarter than that.</p>
		<p>“We're the ones in charge around here. I've memorized...... your face, but your figure is obvious from a distance....... Next time you do something stupid, I’ll twist more than just one arm, understood?”</p>

		<p>He leaned forward and exhaled onto the back of the man’s neck, his breath reeking with the raw smell of a fierce animal just before it bites into its prey. The man turned pale and nodded several times. As soon as Vincent released his arm, he fled, nearly ripping the door off the hinges of the store before he had time to say a word.</p>
		<p>“Well done! Thanks for the help, Vincent!” The sales clerk took Vincent’s hand and praised him.</p>
		<p>“Hey, come on. This is our territory. We're not going to let some stranger make a big show of it.”</p>
		<p>“I’ll put some boiled eggs on your next bouncer’s bill!”</p>
		<p>“No no ......, just give me the money.......” responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>Natalia couldn’t help but let out an exhale of admiration when she saw Vincent exchanging a wry smile with Jackson. He was in complete control of his violent and ferocious nature as a beastman. He also knows how to use it to blend in well with human society and how to avoid using it when he needs to. She had never met anyone like him before.</p>
		<p>“I am surprised that there are beastmen who only use their powers minimally. It was as if you were really protecting the security of the city.”</p>
		<p>As the car started up again, Natalia gave Vincent her honest opinion. He rubbed the bridge of his nose saying, “Well, if I got into trouble every time there was an altercation and didn’t use my powers minimally, the people would run away and I wouldn’t be able to get the bouncer’s fee. Everything is for business.”</p>
		<p>“Business?” Natalia furrowed her brow when she heard that word. It was a word that seemed to be at the top of the list of words that didn’t belong to beastmen.</p>
		<p>“The times, they are a-changin'," replied Jackson in the driver’s seat in a somewhat grandiose manner. “There is a man who has called for the establishment of an underworld order centered on doing business, saying that it is a great loss when gangs beat each other up. His name is Lucky Salvatore. His ideas have spread widely, and violence is becoming the gangs’ last resort. We're on board with that.”</p>
		<p>“Well, in the end, it’s power that counts.” Vincent pounded his fist into the palm of his hand.</p>
		<p>“The bigger the city, the less graceful it can be. There will always be shady areas. The only people who can control these areas are the shady people who can control the violence. Even if the police or the government tries to suppress them, the people living in the shadows will scatter and gather again. They can’t control the people living behind the scenes, the bad guys are in charge. That’s the best way.”</p>

		<p>Before long, Natalia found herself nodding repeatedly as she listened intently to the conversation that was somehow turning into a confirmation of ideals. Vincent might indeed be one of the group of so-called scoundrels, she was not sure if she wanted to follow his example, however, she could say a couple of good things about him. Vincent was not only the first beastman of his type that Natalia had ever met, he was also more reasonable than any other beastman she had ever met.</p>
		<p>The next day, the beastmen who had come as illegal immigrants began to work. The fact that they were relatively mild-mannered beastmen helped, and they obeyed Vincent and his team’s instructions and began to do more and more things. After a few days, it was not unusual to see bovine beastmen, their faces hidden by hats and masks, carrying large loads with ease behind Vincent and his men, who kept an eye out at the pier for any suspicious cargo or people. They seemed to have taken to the job quickly. At noon, they all would gather at the usual warehouse and have lunch together. Occasionally, family members who worked at restaurants or cleaning companies would come and join everyone for lunch. The elaborate cuisine of the humans was a new experience for the beastmen, who had only eaten simple food in the past. The meat and bread sandwiches, drenched in chemical seasonings, were obviously unhealthy, but the taste was strangely addictive. All of the faces that had been dark and depressed back home in Europe showed no concern or dissatisfaction with the life they were now leading here.</p>
		<p>Maybe we don’t need to stay here anymore, Natalia thought. In this corner of the port town, the beastmen would be able to live happily together.</p>
		<p>And yet, Shirou was reluctant to leave. He watched over the beastmen from morning to night, and accompanied Vincent and Jackson on almost all of their work, and even when he was sure that their actions were not harmful to the beastmen, he still did not stop looking at them with suspicion.</p>
		<p>Natalia wondered if Shirou had smelled something. Whenever she asked him, his answer was always just one sentence: "Humans cannot be trusted.”</p>
		<p>Natalia began to worry that his attitude would cause tension between Vincent and the others. No matter how calm Jackson was, he would be insulted if Shirou continued to harbor such suspicion. She wondered if there was any way she could convince him.......</p>
		<p>As Natalia soothed her exhausted mind with the unfamiliar music on the radio, she turned her head to the sound of two footsteps and conversation approaching from the back of the warehouse.</p>
		<p>“Hey, little crow girl.”</p>
		<p>Vincent held up one hand, and Jackson smiled at her.</p>

		<p>“The crow is Kuro, and I’m Natalia.” When Natalia corrected him, the black panther apologized lightly and looked around as if searching for someone.”</p>
		<p>“Where’s Ogami?”</p>
		<p>“He went to check on the people at the restaurant.”</p>
		<p>“Good work. It’s nice to know that there’s someone who can keep an eye on the beastmen.”</p>
		<p>Natalia was a little relieved. Vincent did not seem to be annoyed by Shirou’s behavior.</p>
		<p>“What are you listening to?” Jackson asked, referring to the music on the radio.</p>
		<p>“I don’t know. Fabio said it was called country music. It makes me feel relaxed.” Responded</p>
		<p>Natalia.</p>
		<p>“You seem to be interested in human culture. Do you like music?”</p>
		<p>“Y-yes, I do!” Natalia nodded, feeling the words catch in her throat. She couldn’t give a straightforward affirmation, but she tilted her head in an unnatural way.</p>
		<p>“If you want, I'd be happy to take you to a place where you can listen to some real jazz. I know a group that survived the heyday of big bands in the thirties. Their music was like lullabies for me. I’m looking for more fans.” Responded Jackson.</p>
		<p>She was baffled by his enthusiasm. It was not an invitation that she could easily follow.</p>
		<p>“Don’t do that. You can’t take a kid like her to a place full of delinquents like that. Ogami will beat the shit out of you.” Vincent laughed, but when he retracted his smile, he suddenly looked around and asked in a lowered voice, "Hey, Natalia. Who the hell is that Ogami?”</p>
		<p>“What?”</p>
		<p>Natalia stared back at Vincent’s face, he had a very serious expression.</p>
		<p>“I said before that it’s like he’s got hell inside him, but that’s all of it. If there is such a thing as hellfire, it’s the glow in his eyes is it. It’s like a fire that won’t go out and continues to burn inside his body forever......, I can feel that kind of bad vibe coming off of him.”</p>
		<p>“Hmmm......, that’s a bit vague, isn’t it?” Jackson called out to him, in a serious manner.</p>
		<p>“Yeah. Sometimes I don’t know what’s going on either. Ogami looks both young and very old.</p>
		<p>He’s a strange guy, really.......” Vincent sighed tiredly.</p>
		<p>“I've been trying to figure him out, just like he’s been trying to figure us out. I’m confident in my eyes.”</p>

		<p>“I’m sure of the black panther’s eyes as well,” Jackson nodded in agreement.</p>
		<p>“I noticed it when I was watching Ogami that he might be...... empty.” Continued Vincent.</p>
		<p>“Empty ......?” Natalia was shivering in surprise. Vincent must have taken this as anger, because he hurriedly lifted his hand in a small, soothing motion.</p>
		<p>“I’m not calling him some kind of flimsy, empty-headed bastard. I think there’s a hell of a lot of substance to him, but I don’t think it’s his true nature at all. So, Natalia…?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, sir?” She realized that she was nervous for some reason when he called her name.</p>
		<p>“What kind of a guy is Ogami? What’s he doing here in the United States, helping these beastmen? It’s not that it’s a big deal or anything, it’s okay, but what does he like? What does he hate? I just want to make sure there’s a person in Ogami, even if it’s just a small one.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, I’m starting to think he’s some kind of monster.”</p>
		<p>“Dislikes......, probably humans.”</p>
		<p>When she looked at Jackson apologetically, he nodded with a wry smile and said, "I know exactly what you mean.”</p>
		<p>How could these shrewd gang members not notice? Natalia thought.</p>
		<p>“Likes……, imitating a sheep dog….?”</p>
		<p>“What did you just say ......?” Vincent froze, then suddenly opened his mouth wide and started laughing.</p>
		<p>“I see. I don’t know about that one, he likes that kind of stuff? Don’t take it personally, I’m just relieved. That’s the kind of answer I was hoping to hear, I guess.”</p>
		<p>Just then, a beastman came through the doorway of the warehouse. ”Mr. Vincent, Mr.</p>
		<p>Jackson, what are you doing? We're all waiting for you.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, yeah, I’m just here to get some tools.” Vincent responds to the beastman.</p>
		<p>“We've been talking for a while. I’ll see you at the break, Natalia.”</p>
		<p>“Yeah...... Good luck with your work......”</p>
		<p>After seeing them off, Natalia was alone, pressing her palm hard against her still restless chest to silence it. Before she knew it, cold sweat was running down her back, leaving</p>
		<p>Vincent’s jovial laughter in her ears.</p>

		<p>I don’t know…</p>
		<p>Impatience and anxiety made Natalia scream the words in her chest.</p>
		<p>I don’t know anything else about Mr. Ogami......!</p>
		<p>He is the Silver Wolf, a special being who has lived for a thousand years. Somehow she decided that was just who he was, but of course, there had to be more to him than that. She could understand why Vincent felt relieved earlier, he saw a person in him.</p>
		<p>Natalia, who had been watching Shirou for a while now, naturally felt the same way. Her thoughts began to flow.</p>
		<p>He is not a god, he is a person, but I don’t even know if he is really a beastman. Is there such a thing as a beastman who can live for a thousand years? How could he live that long?</p>
		<p>Where was he born? Where is his family? Why... Why is he on a journey to save beastmen?</p>
		<p>For him, eternity is real, but it is empty....</p>
		<p>The sound of that word, “empty,” grated on her ears.</p>
		<p>There was a reason why Vincent’s words had left such an eerie echo in the air. It was just the other day. Natalia and Shirou were watching a cramped, but happy, family of beastmen in the apartment they had been given from the rooftop of a building across the street.</p>
		<p>“They seem to be okay now.” Natalia spoke</p>
		<p>“Yeah.......” responded Shirou.</p>
		<p>When she turned towards the direction of the not-so-happy voice, Shirou was only giving them a dull look.</p>
		<p>“Don’t you like the fact that they live in a human city?” He followed up.</p>
		<p>Natalia was silent, but he was half right.</p>
		<p>If one were to look behind them, they could see the ocean. Other than that, the human city stretched out in every direction. It seems more unrealistic to try and find a mountain or forest where they could live. Even in a place like this, what more could Natalia ask for as a person who has been protecting these people, for them to be able to spend their lives without their families being torn apart?</p>
		<p>What makes a beastman happy? She thought.</p>
		<p>“What does happiness mean to you, Mr. Ogami?” She asked him half-jokingly.</p>

		<p>“Happiness?......”</p>
		<p>He looked at her, as if he hadn’t ever thought about the subject, and his expression was as sad as a lost child, which put Natalia at a loss for words.</p>
		<p>Then he answered, “I don’t know what it was. I forgot all about that a long time ago.”</p>
		<p>His voice stuck in her ears. The Savior. The Silver Wolf. The master of a thousand-year legend.</p>
		<p>What is Shirou Ogami?</p>
		<p>The next day, Natalia began to worry about where to put the doubts that had grown in her mind. The girls were gathering at the warehouse for lunch as usual. Jackson came running into the room with a pep in his step.</p>
		<p>Vincent, you guys are going to be happy. That dream’s about to come true!</p>
		<p>Really, Jackson!?</p>
		<p>“Yeah!”</p>
		<p>The gang stood up at once, and Fabio, the youngest of them all, was so excited that he took</p>
		<p>Natalia’s hand and started dancing with her. Even the sight of Kuro flying away from them in the commotion was like a white pigeon being released during a ceremony.</p>
		<p>“What’s going on?” Shirou, remaining as cold as a mammoth dipped in ice, asks Vincent with a dubious look on his face.</p>
		<p>“Oh, we've been recognized for our work, and we're going to be added to the family under the umbrella of Salvatore, the big gang boss in this city.”</p>
		<p>“Salvatore?” Natalia asked back.</p>
		<p>Fabio, still dancing, answered, “He is the leader of the five families that rule this city. He’s the guy who brought the gangs together after they had been fighting each other in a bunch of bloody battles. He’s an amazing guy.”</p>
		<p>Natalia recalled Jackson mentioning something like that to her once. He is the man who transformed the gangs of this city into a well-organized, but violent group.</p>
		<p>Jackson coughed and everyone’s attention turned back to him. “My family was the one who was recognized, but I’m going to recommend Vincent and the others the next time we meet.</p>
		<p>After all, we are two families in one.”</p>

		<p>“Come on, Jackson. It’s our dream to make a name for ourselves in this city,” Vincent and Jackson clapped their hands together lightly, and then clasped them tightly.</p>
		<p>Even the immigrant beastmen, who had no idea how human society worked, were beaming as if something good had just happened. Even after Jackson left, saying he had some business to attend to, the excitement of the beastman gang continued.</p>
		<p>“It’s been a few years since we drifted into this city....... The fruits of your labor are finally paying off, Vincent!”</p>
		<p>“Maybe one day I’ll have a subordinate as a member of the Vincent family. And then I’ll be in charge of a city like this one, where I can-......!” Fabio, in particular, had not returned from his daydream and was unaware that a large moth had closed in on his face.</p>
		<p>However, there was one man who blew away all that enthusiasm with a single sentence.</p>
		<p>“Humans will always betray beastmen.” It was Shirou.</p>
		<p>Even as the four gangsters glared at him, Shirou’s gaze was somber, as he looked back at them with an oppressive weight in his eyes.</p>
		<p>“It’s best not to trust them too much.”</p>
		<p>“What the hell, you don’t know shit!”</p>
		<p>Vincent admonished one exasperated gangster with a look that said, "Stop it.”</p>
		<p>His gruff voice echoed in the freezing air of the warehouse, “Ogami, I understand what you're saying. Humans and beastmen have never been able to understand each other.”</p>
		<p>“We never will.”</p>
		<p>“But it’s okay. We and Jackson have the same values. Do you understand?” Vincent told the mute Shirou.</p>
		<p>“Power.” He clenched his fist in front of Shirou. Slowly the fist started changing color, turning into the color of a black panther.</p>
		<p>Vincent, now an unmistakable black panther beastman, looks at the old wolf with his strong, thoughtful, emerald green eyes. “We gangsters respect and admire the powerful. The power and speed of a beastman, the cleverness of a human, both are necessary in this city. It doesn’t matter where you come from or where you grew up, as long as you have a little civility and never betray us. We're all the same, and we're not the only one who thinks so.”</p>
		<p>Unperturbed by Vincent’s spirit, which made even his friends gasp, Shirou responded coldly.</p>

		<p>“You can’t trust a single human.”</p>
		<p>“Maybe not in your past, but in our present, we can,” retorted Vincent.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a whistle sounded, indicating that a ship had arrived at the port. The beastman workers scurried out to the loading dock, taking advantage of the opportunity to escape the tense conversation. Fabio and the others also rushed out, looking back at Vincent over and over again.</p>
		<p>“We've been stragglers from the start. There’s no place for us in the beastman world now, so we'll make a name for ourselves in this human city.” With those last words, Vincent returned to his human form and walked away from Shirou.</p>
		<p>“Kaa….” Kuro made a small sound as if at a loss, but Shirou kept his back to him and Natalia and did not speak.</p>
		<p>From Natalia’s point of view, the unity between Vincent and Jackson seemed unshakable. To her, it seemed to be a model of bridging distances, shared values, and a way for humans and beastmen to really get along.</p>
		<p>Is Shirou just saying this because he hates humans? A man who hates humans and helps beastmen - an empty man who has nothing else to offer. Such a sinister image weighed heavily on Natalia’s heart.</p>
		<p>It was two days later that the unfortunate news arrived. From the moment Jackson, accompanied by a gangster named Jeff, appeared in the warehouse with a pale face, even the most unsuspecting beastmen could predict that the news wasn’t going to be good.</p>
		<p>In front of Vincent and the others, who were bewildered and silent, Jackson spoke out in a dark, timid voice and said, "I was told to cut you off...... all of the beastmen.......”</p>
		<p>In front of an appalled Natalia and the others, he told them with trembling lips what had happened.</p>
		<p>Lucky Salvator, the face of the Five Families, was imprisoned in the Great Meadow Prison. At the time of his arrest, he was placed in the impregnable Dannemora Prison, where no one has ever escaped, but it is said that, through his power, he had himself transferred to a more comfortable facility in handcuffs.</p>
		<p>Jackson was shocked and speechless as they approached the darkened passageway to a rather brightly lit jail cell. His cell was so opulent that Jackson thought that it was as if a hotel room embedded in it. He had a sofa, a bed, a radio, and even a refrigerator. It was literally a different world from the one with the rats right next door.</p>

		<p>“Boss, I've brought the young man from the Panther’s Mouth.”</p>
		<p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
		<p>He sat down on the sofa, his back to the man who had brought Jackson here, and replied as curtly as if he had ordered room service. A man in an expensive suit, relaxing in a hotel at the back of the prison, that was Salvatore.</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry to have called you all the way here. Well, have a drink.” Offered Salvatore.</p>
		<p>He took a bottle of liquor from the shelf next to the refrigerator and served it to Jackson through a gap in the iron grate. His face was close to Jackson’s. He had an old scar on his face from a gang fight in his past, and his right eyelid was drooping. He looked just like the rumors said he would.</p>
		<p>As Jackson slurped down the glass he received, the heat of the richest Scotch whisky he had ever tasted filled his throat and the back of his stomach.</p>
		<p>“I've heard rumors about the Panther’s mouth. I am sincerely pleased to have a talented young man like you.”</p>
		<p>“Thank you, sir.” Jackson managed to reply, almost choking on the smell of scotch vapors.</p>
		<p>The “Panther’s Mouth” was the nickname of the port that Jackson deliberately spread behind the scenes. It was said that if anyone suspicious or untrustworthy tried to pass through, they would be ambushed by a panther. In the early days of his partnership with Vincent, it had been a bluff to add to their credibility, but now it had become something that people were talking about.</p>
		<p>“I've always felt bad about leaving that plot of land to you guys, with no back-up whatsoever.”</p>
		<p>“No, no way. We think we were given a unique opportunity.”</p>
		<p>Although it is now known as the Panther’s Mouth, until a few years ago Jackson and his friends had been nothing more than a small group of sharp-eyed delinquents who had taken up residence in that neighborhood. The New York gangs’ territories are divided into five parts by the five major families, but at that time, that small port was an independent area that did not belong to any of them. It was treated as a buffer zone between two huge families that were in conflict.</p>
		<p>Inside that region, prior to Jackson’s and Vincent’s arrival, several families had engaged in what became a spiraling conflict. Depressed by the bloodshed, Salvatore was about to send an agent to end it, but the day before he could, the port’s family at the time was wiped out in a horrific killing spree. The five families were not happy to see a power vacuum, but it was obvious that if one of the families absorbed the territory, it would cause more friction</p>

		<p>between all of them. That’s when the Jackson’s group, a gangster group in name only at the time, came into the picture.</p>
		<p>“To be honest, I thought it would be worth it if we could buy some time to adjust our interests, but you guys have done a great job. The Panther’s Mouth is now a prime piece of property that even the other gangsters recognize.”</p>
		<p>Jackson felt his heart race as the smiling king of the underworld said this. Immediately, the satisfaction of knowing that his eyes and his instincts had been right sprung up inside him.</p>
		<p>Immediately after being entrusted with that territory, Jackson and his team had been overwhelmingly lacking in strength to compete with the rough-and-tumble dockworkers.</p>
		<p>No matter how much they used their wits, they had no choice but to back down in the face of raised fists.</p>
		<p>That’s when they met them, the beastmen, who had smuggled themselves into the country.</p>
		<p>The moment Jackson’s eyes met theirs, he knew these were the guys. Thanks to Vincent and the others, there was no one left who could resist them by force. At the same time, the security of the port improved dramatically. Before, only small ramshackle ships would come to the port, but now passenger ships, immigrant ships, and ships carrying important cargo use the Panther’s Mouth for its safety and as a cover for their secret merchandise.</p>
		<p>“That was the long introduction, let’s get down to business. As you've probably already heard, I'd like to invite your family to work for me. You'll be able to run a bigger operation and make more money. There’s nothing to lose on your end, after all, I've already made all the necessary arrangements. In other words, this is purely a thank you from me.”</p>
		<p>There was no reason for Jackson to refuse. However, standing on the verge of his head nodding with a smile gushing from the inside of his body, Jackson made a proposal that he made sure not to forget.</p>
		<p>“I've got some guys I'd like you to take care of with us.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>
		<p>“A guy named Vincent and his friends. Thanks to these guys, we-....”</p>
		<p>“Beastmen, right?”</p>
		<p>The sudden drop in the temperature of Salvatore’s voice confused Jackson, but he nodded,</p>
		<p>“Umm, yes.......”</p>
		<p>The next words thrown at him caught him completely off-guard.</p>
		<p>“Jackson. Cut them off.”</p>

		<p>It was bad news...</p>
		<p>“What!?” Jackson’s eyes bugged out.</p>
		<p>“Get rid of the beastmen. That’s the condition for joining me.”</p>
		<p>“W-....What for!? They're ......!”</p>
		<p>“I can’t accept the beastmen. Cut them off.”</p>
		<p>“.......Oh, no...Oh no! Vincent and the others are useful guys.......!” Spitting out the words with a groan, Jackson slumped.</p>
		<p>It was thanks to Vincent and the others that he was able to grow to this level. It is because of them that he has been able to overwhelm people with power and demonstrate his abilities as a thinker. If he loses them, he will lose it all.......</p>
		<p>As Jackson’s thoughts swirled, Salvatore’s voice fell upon him, “From now on, I’ll lend you people. You won’t have to rely on them anymore. I’m buying your smarts.”</p>
		<p>“Why......?”</p>
		<p>Jackson clenched his fists and continued to Salvatore, “You've risen to your current position by making friends from all walks of life and races. You respected the good guys, put business first, and controlled violence. Even an idiot can see that this is rational. Why change that now?”</p>
		<p>Salvatore’s eyebrows twitched slightly, pulling on his old scar and a very grim expression appeared on his face, probably subconsciously. He exhaled a sigh of sorrow and said, “This guy Vincent,....... he’s letting all the beastmen who come to the harbor live in the city without permission, right?”</p>
		<p>“Yes,....... but they haven’t caused any problems. On the contrary, they work very hard for a low salary. We can use them, the beastmen, they have strength and stamina.......”</p>
		<p>“That’s it.”</p>
		<p>“What?”</p>
		<p>“If they join forces against you, will you be able to fight them?”</p>
		<p>Jackson was at a loss for words. It wasn’t that he hadn’t thought about it. When he first started working with Vincent, he had been wary, “But with Vincent, you can ...... he’ll do whatever you ask. He is a man I can trust. He will never betray me.”</p>

		<p>The reply came back with a deep sigh. “I’ll tell you one more time. Get rid of the beastman. If you can’t do that, then this conversation ends here.”</p>
		<p>“Mr. Salvatore! He would never betray me, but you want me to betray...... him?”</p>
		<p>“I’ve told you what I wanted to tell you. Hey, give him a ride home.”</p>
		<p>In a swift move that did not allow for further conversation, the guide interrupted Jackson.</p>
		<p>Jackson looked over his shoulder and saw that Salvatore was no longer looking at him. No voice could reach him anymore. The only thing that could be given to Salvatore as an answer now, was action. Jackson, confronted with this realization, had no choice but to leave quietly.</p>
		<p>“What the hell is that ......?” It was the youngest, Fabio, who was the first to voice his emotions and slam him.</p>
		<p>“He can’t accept us because we're beastmen!”</p>
		<p>Natalia’s chest tightened as she felt his anger through the air, as he had accepted the hope of this opportunity more honestly and happily than anyone else.</p>
		<p>It’s happening again. This will happen again. Beastmen and humans. The same result again. Naturally, she searched Shirou with her eyes. He crossed his arms tightly, his face grim as ever, and said nothing.</p>
		<p>After glancing at his indignant companion, Vincent turned to face a nodding Jackson.</p>
		<p>“So, what are you going to say?”</p>
		<p>“Kick that shit to the curb!” Vincent’s companion growled from beside him, but Jackson tried to keep his voice low.</p>
		<p>“I’ll see him again, somehow, and talk to him again. I’m sure he'll understand. If he’s that kind of person,......”</p>
		<p>“......What are your friends saying?” responded Vincent.</p>
		<p>Jackson made eye contact with Jeff and nodded, “I've talked to Dominic and Peter. I’m sure they understand. No one’s going to cut you guys loose just to make themselves look good, but this is a big opportunity. If we miss it, we'll never be this lucky again. We have to make it work... somehow! But......”</p>
		<p>“Isn’t that funny about this Lucky guy?” Everyone in the room reacted to Natalia’s voice, who had spoken up suddenly without any introduction. “As much as I hate to admit it’s because he’s a bad person, you guys are as rational about things as anyone I've ever met. If there is a risk of betrayal or rebellion, the other families are no different. In fact, humans are more</p>

		<p>dangerous because of their grudges. There are far fewer beastmen than humans in the first place, why should he be so wary of them?”</p>
		<p>“That’s what I don’t understand.” Jackson buried his face in his hands.</p>
		<p>“Maybe Mr. Salvatore doesn’t know much about beastmen? Maybe he’s afraid of them because he doesn’t know them.”</p>
		<p>“Natalia, there’s no way that man doesn’t know. He’s in jail and is able to get information from all over New York. But...... yes. I've never heard of him having any problems with beastmen in the past. This should have been a way of getting rid of those emotional conflicts and proceeding with things rationally in the first place. There is something wrong with this.......”</p>
		<p>“If he’s being contradictory, there must be a reason for it.” Natalia looked at Jackson and Vincent, “If we can use that as a springboard, maybe he'll listen to you.”</p>
		<p>Jackson looked up and there was an intelligent glint in his eye as he realized something.</p>
		<p>Fabio, who was completely sulking, pouted his lips and followed up, “But what, for example, is that reason?”</p>
		<p>“The simplest possibility is that they were instructed to do so by someone much higher up.......” Natalia responded, and the boy looked dumbfounded.</p>
		<p>“Heck, he’s the boss of bosses. No one is higher than that.” retorted Fabio.</p>
		<p>“No, not really.” Jackson countered.</p>
		<p>“Salvatore is trying to make a deal with the federal government for amnesty. There are even stories that he has even helped the military in their operations. If the government orders him to eliminate the beastmen, he will have no choice but to comply.”</p>
		<p>“What then? If we storm the prison and break him out, won’t the problem be solved?”</p>
		<p>Jackson responded immediately to Vincent’s words, "It’s not that simple. He wants to be free legally. If he escapes, he'll be hounded by the police for the rest of his life. There’s no point in that. We're small-time crooks, we can’t make deals with politicians. If we could do that, Lucky would have done it himself.......”</p>
		<p>While the gangsters were arguing, Natalia muttered to herself. “Isn’t it possible that he’s trapped in something much bigger than......?</p>
		<p>They all looked at her suspiciously, “Bigger than the country?” Jackson’s voice nudged her to explain.</p>

		<p>“I have seen many conflicts between beasts and humans. Sure, there are problems between the two of our groups, but...... individually, humans and beastmen can understand each other.</p>
		<p>Just like you guys, but when the scale of the problem grows, it’s as if someone is blocking us from being together. Like this.”</p>
		<p>“Oh, come on, are you talking about fate or destiny?” Vincent looked up at the ceiling, half-amused.</p>
		<p>“No, I think it’s something more artificial......”</p>
		<p>“That sounds like a conspiracy theory.” Jackson said, and then shrugged his shoulders.</p>
		<p>“Someone who controls the world of humans and beastmen behind the scenes?</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, we're the ones on this side of the world, and I've never even heard of such a being.”</p>
		<p>'I guess you’re right....... That was out of place. Forget it.” When Natalia withdrew her ambiguous statement, only a grim silence remained in the room.</p>
		<p>The conversation was at a complete standstill. As Jackson had said, the only way was to meet again and try to convince him somehow. It was at that moment that everyone began to look at each other weakly, hoping that someone would come to a haphazard solution.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, there was a series of roaring engine noises, and then they came to a stop near the warehouse with the high-pitched screech of brakes.</p>
		<p>“What the hell?” Jackson got up and went to the back door with a quizzical look on his face.</p>
		<p>Just as the stagnant air began to move and everyone in the room looked at each other with some relief, Jackson’s dismayed voice echoed from the back door.</p>
		<p>“Dominic, Peter? What the hell are you-”</p>
		<p>The rest of his words were cut short by a constant popping sound. Jackson’s lithe body twitched as if he were dancing. His beloved white shirt quickly turned red, splattered and torn to scraps. At the end of the sound, he collapsed to both knees and then to the ground like a puppet with cut strings, falling to his side without motioning to catch himself, and didn’t move a muscle after that.</p>
		<p>“Jackson!?”</p>
		<p>Jeff was about to rush over to him, but stopped short when a man emerged from behind the doorway. His shout echoed out, "Dominic! What have you done to Jackson? You betrayed him!”</p>

		<p>Dominic’s reply to Jeff was the muzzle of a short machine gun pointed at him.</p>
		<p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa!!”</p>
		<p>As Jeff tried to run back to the group, he tripped over his own feet and fell into a heap in front of Natalia. The light and the sound of gunfire filled the dimly lit corner of the warehouse, and Jeff’s back burst open with the clothes he was wearing. It was as if a school of fish were jumping up and down on his back.</p>
		<p>A few moments later, everyone was horrified to see a red liquid spreading slowly across the warehouse floor from underneath his prone body. Jeff was dead, his eyes widened in horror.</p>
		<p>“Hide!” Shirou shouted, and at the same time, all the beastmen present rushed behind one large container. A series of popping noises filled the warehouse as Natalia followed them.</p>
		<p>Fabio, who was the furthest away, missed his escape, tripped, and fell just in front of the container. The gunfire was moving towards him, making the warehouse floor explode.</p>
		<p>“Aaaah!” screamed Fabio</p>
		<p>“Don’t die here!” Leaning forward, Shirou grabbed Fabio and pulled him into the back behind the container.</p>
		<p>“You're dead, you animals!”</p>
		<p>Just as she thought the storm of bullets had stopped, Natalia heard a high-pitched man’s voice.</p>
		<p>“Damn you, Dominic! What the hell is this!? Peter too!?” Vincent, who had his back pressed against the container next to Natalia, shouted angrily.</p>
		<p>“Damn, you're alive, you stubborn bastard!”</p>
		<p>“You killed Jackson and Jeff! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”</p>
		<p>The voice that came back was trembling with frustration and annoyance. ”Shut the fuck up!</p>
		<p>It’s your fault Jackson didn’t get rid of you all as soon as he could! What are we going to do if this whole deal goes south because of you? I don’t give a shit about an alliance with a beastman!”</p>
		<p>“What are you gonna do without Jackson!?”</p>
		<p>“Shut up! As long as I get new territory and new men, I don’t care!”</p>

		<p>The shouting was interspersed with the sound of footsteps slowly approaching. Natalia looked around with strained eyes. “We have to save everyone somehow. ......! There’s got to be a way to ......!”</p>
		<p>Think. Think. Think. Think. ......!</p>
		<p>Natalia couldn’t think. Whenever she tried to think of something, Jeff’s and Jackson’s dead bodies flashed into her mind. She had just been talking to them, she was overwhelmed.</p>
		<p>They understood the beastmen. They had tried to understand us, and yet, they were killed regardless. No, is that why? Why is this happening? No matter what beastmen do, the humans always bring about this end. What is wrong with them? Is it the beastmen’s fault?</p>
		<p>What’s wrong with humans? The humans. Humans. Even humans are.......</p>
		<p>He grabbed her by the arm and Natalia gasped.</p>
		<p>“We’re going to get out of here, and we're going to force our way out. Do you understand?” It was Shirou.</p>
		<p>He asked everyone else the same question with his eyes, and all the beastman gang members nodded.</p>
		<p>“Whoa!”</p>
		<p>Shirou kicked the large container, sending it gliding across the floor of the warehouse, and sending sparks flying like a wave as it collided with the men.</p>
		<p>“Beast up and run! Disperse!”</p>
		<p>Following his instructions, Vincent and the others transformed into their beast forms at once and ran outside through the wide loading door.</p>
		<p>“Come on!”</p>
		<p>Natalia and Kuro were carried by Shirou as they escaped the warehouse.</p>
		<p>“Don’t let the beastmen escape, especially that black panther bastard!”</p>
		<p>Dominic and Peter’s scratchy voices continued to linger in Natalia’s ears.</p>
		<p>Why is this happening to us? She thought.</p>
		<p>As Shirou jumped from one building to the next, Natalia looked blankly at the scenery of the city that was moving past at breakneck speed. Here was a dream they shared. They had values they could understand, and yet, in the end, this is what happens. This is what happens.</p>
		<p>It’s as if someone really is standing in the way. Someone much bigger than a country.</p>

		<p>Is it a god? She thought.</p>
		<p>“You were right.” A shadow running alongside Shirou told him in a dark voice. It was Vincent, the beastman now turned into a black panther.</p>
		<p>“Jackson was a trustworthy man, but I forgot one thing, humans are greedy. Much more so than us beastmen.......” His voice carried a sense of desolation, but it was different from a deep sadness.</p>
		<p>This is the philosophy of the beastmen, and it is based on their view of life and death.</p>
		<p>Humans fear death and run away from it. Beastmen fear death and dodge it. For the beastmen, death is something that is very close to their hearts. It’s always there, and if you can’t avoid it, it’s over. There’s a certain grace to it. They’re there, and they’re gone.</p>
		<p>Natalia wonders if he will ever be sad about Jackson’s death.</p>
		<p>“That scar is from when you saved Fabio, isn’t it?”</p>
		<p>Hearing Vincent’s words, Natalia noticed for the first time that Shirou’s hand was covered with blood.</p>
		<p>“It’s just a scratch. It’s nothing serious.”</p>
		<p>“But you protected my comrades, that’s for sure. You have my thanks.”</p>
		<p>“What do we do now?” Shirou asked, instead of replying.</p>
		<p>“I don’t know. All I know for sure is that we can’t stay in this city anymore.”</p>
		<p>Vincent’s green eyes looked off into the distance. It was as if he was looking at the remnants of a dream that was flying away at a much faster speed than he was running.</p>
		<p>“Where is your crew?”</p>
		<p>“They all ran off in different directions. We haven’t decided on a meeting place or anything. If they're still alive, maybe we'll see them again. They'll be hiding out for a while.......”</p>
		<p>“What about the beastmen in the harbor?”</p>
		<p>Natalia’s voice interrupted the conversation between the two men. The thought seemed to bother Shirou as well, and he gave Vincent a look.</p>

		<p>Vincent chuckled a little, “We probably don’t need to worry about them. The police usually don’t do their job properly when dealing with beastmen, but when gangs and ports are involved, it’s a different story. They'll jump at the chance to reduce the power of the bad guys.”</p>
		<p>“That’s good.” Natalia said, a little relieved.</p>
		<p>“You guys really like to help beastmen, don’t you?”</p>
		<p>Vincent took another look at Shirou’s bloodstains, and the edges of his tense face relaxed slightly.</p>
		<p>“Of course,” responded Shirou.</p>
		<p>He then asked Vincent, "Are you coming with us?”</p>
		<p>The black-haired beastman moved his head slightly to look back, pondered for a moment, and then announced, “...... No, no, no. Go to the weaker ones. I’m going to be on my own for now. Farwell.”</p>
		<p>Vincent turned ninety degrees and disappeared into the city. The black shadow soon disappeared from sight, buried in the myriad of colorful city lights. He never once looked back at the port that held so many faces and so many memories. This is why the lives of beastmen are so sad.</p>
		<p>“Where are we going, Mr. Ogami?” Natalia asked, regaining her composure.</p>
		<p>“I don’t know, but we're going west, away from the ocean. Once we're away from the harbor, they won’t be able to get at us as easily.”</p>
		<p>“Right.”</p>
		<p>Suddenly, there was a whoosh of wind. Natalia twisted around to look behind her.</p>
		<p>“What!?”</p>
		<p>There was a huge chunk of metal coming at them that she had never seen before.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami!”</p>
		<p>“What the hell is that!?” Shirou’s eyes also bugged out.</p>
		<p>It was an object that looked like a large machine used for loading and unloading cargo at the port, reassembled into a human-like shape. In the center of the frame was a human, holding a control stick and shouting angrily at them.</p>

		<p>“Wait for me, you animals! I’ll kill you with my machine right now!”</p>
		<p>It was their pursuers. The arm of the machine lifted up and made a popping sound with a little smoke. A small gust of wind slipped past Natalia, invisibly quick, as a bullet missed her.</p>
		<p>“Curl up!”</p>
		<p>Holding the shrinking Natalia tighter than ever, Shirou increased his speed.</p>
		<p>“It’s useless! This is a power suit designed for use in war against beastmen! You'll never get away, you dog!”</p>
		<p>Natalia knew from conversions she overheard among the scientists at the beastman camp that the war had produced a number of weapons of various types for use against beastmen.</p>
		<p>It was said that these weapons were all equipped with a strong impact force to suppress the rushing power of beastmen.</p>
		<p>“Excellent.” said the pilot.</p>
		<p>Natalia’s vision descended at once as Shirou jumped into the valley of the buildings. As soon as the wind pressure from the landing blew away the stale smell, he kicked the ground and ran through the alleyway. Natalia managed to see behind her with her unstable vision.</p>
		<p>Despite its large size, the power suit was right behind them.</p>
		<p>“Ha ha ha! Run, run, run! I've killed dozens of beastmen with this thing!”</p>
		<p>Natalia could now feel a different kind of strength in Shirou’s arms as they were wrapped around her body.</p>
		<p>“A little self-control.” Shirou said to himself.</p>
		<p>As he slowed down, he threw Natalia into a large metal trash can and slammed the lid down mercilessly in the process.</p>
		<p>“You've finally given up! Now I’m going to turn you into a beehive, you barbarian!”</p>
		<p>Natalia lifted the lid slightly and stared desperately at the scene outside. The power suit was firing wildly at Shirou, who was jumping around. The deafening sound of gunfire overtook the sound of the brick apartment walls popping and shattering as bullets struck them and shrapnel fell to the ground.</p>
		<p>“Damn it, this guy, he’s all over the place!” The iron lump chases after Shirou, who moves three-dimensionally around the narrow space of the back alley, using a leaping power that belies his huge size. The wall that he had used as a foothold was shattered and the railing of</p>

		<p>the stairs that he had grabbed was bent, but the line of fire from the gun did not overlap with</p>
		<p>Shirou’s movements.</p>
		<p>“What’s going on ......!? This is a weapon designed to move as fast as a cheetah-like beastman!</p>
		<p>Why can’t I catch you!?” The man controlling the machine shouted in a hoarse voice.</p>
		<p>A cold voice came back from Shirou, who had become gray belt-like afterimage in the back alley.</p>
		<p>“Your eyes.”</p>
		<p>“Eyes?”</p>
		<p>Shirou’s words were spoken to the pilot as he kicked the wall and bounced sinuously through the space between buildings.</p>
		<p>“Beastmen who live in the world of high speed, like cheetahs and falcons, have eyes that are strong enough not to be swayed by that speed. However, your eyes are still just human. You can’t track your prey with them.”</p>
		<p>“Don’t kid yourself! How about this!”</p>
		<p>The arm of the machine pointed at Shirou, from it, countless arrows shot out in unison. With no place to flee, the numerous arrowheads spread out like a torrential downpour, closing in on him. Shirou couldn’t avoid them.</p>
		<p>He plunged straight into the storm of arrows, twisting his body with the grace of a fish, and passed through it unharmed. He had slipped through the gaps between all the arrows.</p>
		<p>“The gaps are bigger if you shoot from that far away.”</p>
		<p>After zigzagging through the air, Shirou’s shadow finally landed on the top of the power suit, right above the pilot. His hand, wrapped in animal fur, gripped the suit’s frame so tightly that it made a crunching sound. The wolf’s eyes glowed darkly.</p>
		<p>“Remember, human. Running on the grasslands is not the same as living on the grasslands.”</p>
		<p>“Wait, wait, wait!“</p>
		<p>The man’s scream stopped Shirou’s fist a millimeter in front of his face.</p>
		<p>“I've never really killed a beastman before, I just maintained these things in the army! I’m just trying to save my life.......!</p>
		<p>“Oh.”</p>

		<p>Shirou nodded and fired his fist again from that position, stopping it at exactly zero millimeters, and punched the man in the face. The seat that was holding his body in place was stretched to its limit, and the man hit the back of his head on the metal frame, knocking him completely unconscious.</p>
		<p>“I could tell by the way you smell.”</p>
		<p>The power suit didn’t move any more after that.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami!”</p>
		<p>Natalia crawled out of the trash can to greet the victorious Shirou. Even against such a mechanical monster, he was not afraid at all, nor did he lag behind. He was never empty. He was, after everything, a very strong and brave beastman.</p>
		<p>“Wait, Natalia!”</p>
		<p>It was only after she had already let her entire body out that Shirou’s sharp voice rang out in restraint.</p>
		<p>“Go fuck yourselves! You bastards!”</p>
		<p>A voice filled with hatred reached Natalia’s ears as if she were being beaten. She turned around to see a gangster holding a machine gun to his waist. Time froze, not even a second before her death, an arm reached out from the side and pushed her away.</p>
		<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
		<p>The sound of gunpowder bursting and a spray of blood landed on Natalia. Shirou had pushed her away. So he was shot instead.</p>
		<p>“AAAAAAAAGGHHH!!!”</p>
		<p>Shirou, covered in blood, threw a nearby drum with all of his strength as he yelled at the top of his lungs.</p>
		<p>“Oh, my God!” The drum collided with the gunman, and with a broken scream, he was blown in a backward direction and stopped moving. Shirou saw this and fell on his back as well.</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami! Mr. Ogami! Aaaaaaah!” Natalia screamed as she clung to Shirou.</p>
		<p>His gray hair and clothes were covered in blood, and she had no idea where he had been shot. Tears spilled incessantly down her face.</p>

		<p>“For my sake,...... You have to protect me......!”</p>
		<p>The god. The silver god is going to die! She thought.</p>
		<p>“I’m fine.......!” Shirou groaned, blood bubbles sticking to the edges of his mouth, as he tried to sit up.</p>
		<p>“No! ......! No, please! You can’t be okay! Don’t move, please!” Natalia desperately tried to hold</p>
		<p>Shirou’s body down.</p>
		<p>“Just back away a little,......! Gaaaahhhh!”</p>
		<p>Natalia screamed again as a stream of blood spurted from Shirou’s body all at once. There was a metallic ping, and something hit the toe-tip of Natalia’s shoe. It was a bloody bullet with a cracked tip that appeared in her tear-stained vision.</p>
		<p>“Whew......!” Shirou exhaled heavily.</p>
		<p>The blood stopped spurting out like a geyser, and the gunshot wounds that were in plain view began to fill up.</p>
		<p>“What!?” Exclaimed Natalia.</p>
		<p>Shirou smiled bitterly as he plopped his hand on Natalia’s sobbing head, “My body is special, you know. I’m not getting buried any time soon.”</p>
		<p>“Mr. Ogami...... Mr. Ogami......! W-why save something like me?.....”</p>
		<p>Unable to find the words to say anything else, Shirou gently grabbed Natalia’s shoulder as if he were soothing a child. “You're an upstanding beastman. You were thinking about saving the other beastmen right up until the end. Don’t call yourself a ‘something.’ If you say that, I’ll become a ‘something’ too.”</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry....... I’m so sorry.......” As she continued to be tossed about by her mixed emotions of fear and sadness, Shirou patted Natalia on the head with an exasperated pat and then gently placed Kuro on top of her.</p>
		<p>“That said, it’s time to get out of here. Give me your shoulder. Even if I’m immortal, it still hurts when I get shot.” To Natalia, the man saying this now was a kind and gentle beastman unlike any other.</p>
		<p>Natalia smiled, wiping her still flowing tears. If there was a god in this world, he would not be so cruel as to not let humans and beasts get along, he would be like the god Natalia knew, scarred and lonely, but full of kindness.</p>

		<p>“Why are you so willing to help the beastmen ......?” She lends him her shoulder and they stand up, sharing the weight of his large body as she asks him the question.</p>
		<p>“Do we need a reason to help our people?”</p>
		<p>“A person without a reason can’t be this strong.”</p>
		<p>Rubbing her eyes hard, Natalia looked at him. He looked a little surprised at her immediate retort, but then chuckled quietly, biting his lips slightly.</p>
		<p>“I’m not sure why....... I’m sure it’s just a small thing.”</p>
		<p>His voice sank quietly into Natalia’s chest. She was sure Shirou had been hurt and suffered many times while saving beastmen like this. He had always been the one to help, and how many others had lent him a shoulder like this?</p>
		<p>In the legend of the Silver Wolf, there are no partners. He was always alone. The lonely look on his face at that time, when he mentioned he had forgotten what happiness looked like, came back to her mind.</p>
		<p>Natalia felt that this time, she wanted to help Shirou.</p>
